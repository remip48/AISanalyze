	abstract = {Food chain theory is one of the cornerstones of ecology, providing many of its basic predictions, such as biomass pyramids, trophic cascades and predator–prey oscillations. Yet, ninety years into this theory, the conditions under which these patterns may occur and persist in nature remain subject to debate. Rather than address each pattern in isolation, we propose that they must be understood together, calling for synthesis in a fragmented landscape of theoretical and empirical results. As a ﬁrst step, we propose a minimal theory that combines the long-standing energetic and dynamical approaches of food chains. We chart theoretical predictions on a concise map, where two main regimes emerge: across various functioning and stability metrics, one regime is characterised by pyramidal patterns and the other by cascade patterns. The axes of this map combine key physiological and ecological variables, such as metabolic rates and self-regulation. A quantitative comparison with data sheds light on conﬂicting theoretical predictions and empirical puzzles, from size spectra to causes of trophic cascade strength. We conclude that drawing systematic connections between various existing approaches to food chains, and between their predictions on functioning and stability, is a crucial step in confronting this theory to real ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Although density-dependent dispersal and relative dispersal (the difference in dispersal rates between species) have been documented in natural systems, their effects on the stability of metacommunities are poorly understood. Here we investigate the effects of intra- and interspeciﬁc density-dependent dispersal on the regional stability in a predator–prey metacommunity model. We show that, when the dynamics of the populations reach equilibrium, the stability of the metacommunity is not affected by density-dependent dispersal. However, the regional stability, measured as the regional variability or the persistence, can be modiﬁed by density-dependent dispersal when local populations ﬂuctuate over time. Moreover these effects depend on the relative dispersal of the predator and the prey. Regional stability is modiﬁed through changes in spatial synchrony. Interspeciﬁc density-dependent dispersal always desynchronizses local dynamics, whereas intraspeciﬁc density-dependent dispersal may either synchronize or desynchronize it depending on dispersal rates. Moreover, intra- and interspeciﬁc density-dependent dispersal strengthen the top-down control of the prey by the predator at intermediate dispersal rates. As a consequence the regional stability of the metacommunity is increased at intermediate dispersal rates. Our results show that density-dependent dispersal and relative dispersal of species are keys to understanding the response of ecosystems to fragmentation.},

Variability, however, often depends on external factors that act as disturbances, which makes comparisons across systems difﬁcult to interpret. Here, we show how variability can reveal inherent stability properties of ecological communities. This requires that we abandon onedimensional representations, in which a single variability measurement is taken as a proxy for how stable a system is, and instead consider the whole set of variability values generated by all possible stochastic perturbations. Despite this complexity, in species-rich systems, a generic pattern emerges from community assembly, relating variability to the abundance of perturbed species. Strikingly, the contrasting contributions of different species abundance classes to variability, driven by different types of perturbations, can lead to opposite diversity–stability patterns. We conclude that a multidimensional perspective on variability helps reveal the dynamical richness of ecological systems and the underlying meaning of their stability patterns.},

	abstract = {There is increasing evidence that top-down controls have strong non-consumptive effects on herbivore populations. However, little is known about how these non-consumptive effects relate to bottom-up influences. Using a series of field trials, we tested how changes in top-down and bottom-up controls at the within-plant scale interact to increase herbivore suppression. In the first experiment, we manipulated access of natural populations of predators (primarily lady beetles) to controlled numbers of A. glycines on upper (i.e. vigorous-growing) versus lower (i.e. slow-growing) soybean nodes and under contrasting plant ages. In a second experiment, we measured aphid dispersion in response to predation. Bottom-up and top-down controls had additive effects on A. glycines population growth. Plant age and within-plant quality had significant bottom-up effects on aphid size and population growth. However, top-down control was the dominant force suppressing aphid population growth, and completely counteracted bottom-up effects at the plant and within-plant scales. The intensity of predation was higher on upper than lower soybean nodes, and resulted in a non-consumptive reduction in aphid population growth because most of the surviving aphids were located on lower plant nodes, where rates of increase were reduced. No effects of predation on aphid dispersal among plants were detected, suggesting an absence of predator avoidance behavior by A. glycines. Our results revealed significant non-consumptive predator impacts on aphids due to the asymmetric intensity of predation at the within-plant scale, suggesting that low numbers of predators are highly effective at suppressing aphid populations.},

	abstract = {There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem processes in changing environments, but the mechanisms that underlie this effect are still controversial and poorly understood. Here, we extend mechanistic theory of ecosystem stability in competitive communities to clarify the mechanisms underlying diversity–stability relationships. We ﬁrst explain why, contrary to a widely held belief, interspeciﬁc competition should generally play a destabilising role. We then explore the stabilising effect of differences in species’ intrinsic rates of natural increase and provide a synthesis of various potentially stabilising mechanisms. Three main mechanisms are likely to operate in the stabilising effects of biodiversity on ecosystem properties: (1) asynchrony of species’ intrinsic responses to environmental ﬂuctuations, (2) differences in the speed at which species respond to perturbations, (3) reduction in the strength of competition. The ﬁrst two mechanisms involve temporal complementarity between species, while the third results from functional complementarity. Additional potential mechanisms include selection effects, behavioural changes resulting from species interactions and mechanisms arising from trophic or non-trophic interactions and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that mechanistic trait-based approaches are key to predicting the effects of diversity on ecosystem stability and to bringing the old diversity–stability debate to a ﬁnal resolution.},

These pigment classes are the short wavelength-sensitive (SWS1) pigment and the long wavelength-sensitive (LWS) pigment, orthologues of the same pigments found in many other vertebrates, as well as the middle wavelength-sensitive (MWS) pigment, a paralogue to the LWS pigment. Trichromacy was achieved differently in Old World and New World primates. In Old World primates, a duplication of the LWS opsin gene occurred giving rise to a “red-sensitive” or L pigment and a “green-sensitive” or M pigment. Their corresponding L and M genes are adjacent on the X chromosome which, together with their high sequence homology, is the underlying cause for the high frequency of red-green color blindness seen in humans. In New World primates and prosimians, however, the mechanism leading to trichromacy, with one exception, is based on a single polymorphic LWS gene, from which different allelic variants encode pigments with differing spectral peaks. X chromosome inactivation limits expression to just one gene per photoreceptor meaning that trichromacy is only seen in females; while all male are red-green color blind. Despite several leading hypotheses, the reasons for the different evolutionary paths taken by Old and New World primates for trichromacy are still unclear and remain to be conﬁrmed.},

	abstract = {Effective species conservation and management requires information on species distribution patterns, which is challenging for highly mobile and cryptic species that may be subject to multiple anthropogenic stressors across international boundaries. Understanding species–h­ abitat relationships can improve the assessment of trends and distribution by explicitly allowing high-­resolution data on habitats to inform abundance estimation and the identification of protected areas. In this study, we aggregated an unprecedented set of survey data of a marine top predator, the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), collected in the UK (SCANS II, Dogger Bank), Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark, to develop seasonal habitat-­based density models for the central and southern North Sea. Visual survey data were collected over 9 yr (2005–2013) by means of dedicated line-­transect surveys, taking into account the proportion of missed sightings. Generalized additive models of porpoise density were fitted to 156,630 km of on-e­ ffort survey data with 14,356 sightings of porpoise groups. Selected predictors included static and dynamic variables, such as depth, distance to shore and to sandeel (Ammodytes spp.) grounds, sea surface temperature (SST), proxies for fronts, and day length. Day length and the spatial distribution of daily SST proved to be good proxies for “season,” allowing predictions in both space and time. The density models captured seasonal distribution shifts of porpoises across international boundaries. By combining the large-­scale international SCANS II survey with the more frequent, small-s­ cale national surveys, it has been possible to provide seasonal maps that will be used to assist the EU Habitats and Marine Strategy Framework Directives in effectively assessing the conservation status of harbor porpoises. Moreover, our results can facilitate the identification of regions where human activities and disturbances are likely to impact the population and are especially relevant for marine spatial planning, which requires accurate fine-­scale maps of species distribution to assess risks of increasing human activities at sea.},

	abstract = {Many previous studies have attempted to assess ecological niche modeling performance using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) approaches, even though diverse problems with this metric have been pointed out in the literature. We explored different evaluation metrics based on independent testing data using the Darwin’s Fox (Lycalopex fulvipes) as a detailed case in point. Six ecological niche models (ENMs; generalized linear models, boosted regression trees, Maxent, GARP, multivariable kernel density estimation, and NicheA) were explored and tested using six evaluation metrics (partial ROC, Akaike information criterion, omission rate, cumulative binomial probability), including two novel metrics to quantify model extrapolation versus interpolation (E-­space index I) and extent of extrapolation versus Jaccard similarity (E-­space index II). Different ENMs showed diverse and mixed performance, depending on the evaluation metric used. Because ENMs performed differently according to the evaluation metric employed, model selection should be based on the data available, assumptions necessary, and the particular research question. The typical ROC AUC evaluation approach should be discontinued when only presence data are available, and evaluations in environmental dimensions should be adopted as part of the toolkit of ENM researchers. Our results suggest that selecting Maxent ENM based solely on previous reports of its performance is a questionable practice. Instead, model comparisons, including diverse algorithms and parameterizations, should be the sine qua non for every study using ecological niche modeling. ENM evaluations should be developed using metrics that assess desired model characteristics instead of single measurement of fit between model and data. The metrics proposed herein that assess model performance in environmental space (i.e., E-­space indices I and II) may complement current methods for ENM evaluation.},

Differences in methods between disciplines reﬂect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is inﬂuenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress.

We compiled a geo-spatial database of published data on cetacean abundance from dedicated visual line-transect surveys and encoded .1100 abundance estimates for 47 species from 430 surveys conducted worldwide from 1975–2005. Our subsequent analyses revealed large spatial, temporal and taxonomic variability and gaps in survey coverage. With the exception of Antarctic waters, survey coverage was biased toward the northern hemisphere, especially US and northern European waters. Overall, ,25\% of the world’s ocean surface was surveyed and only 6\% had been covered frequently enough (\$5 times) to allow trend estimation. Almost half the global survey effort, defined as total area (km2) covered by all survey study areas across time, was concentrated in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP). Neither the number of surveys conducted nor the survey effort had increased in recent years. Across species, an average of 10\% of a species’ predicted range had been covered by at least one survey, but there was considerable variation among species. With the exception of three delphinid species, ,1\% of all species’ ranges had been covered frequently enough for trend analysis. Sperm whales emerged from our analyses as a relatively data-rich species. This is a notoriously difficult species to survey visually, and we use this as an example to illustrate the challenges of using available data from line-transect surveys for the detection of trends or for spatial planning. We propose field and analytical methods to fill in data gaps to improve cetacean conservation efforts.},

Quantifying range ﬁlling (R/P) as realized/potential range size ratios using bioclimatic envelope modelling we find mean R/P ¼ 38.3\% (±30.3\% SD). Many European tree species naturalize extensively outside their native ranges, providing support for interpreting the many low R/Ps as primarily reflecting dispersal limitation. R/P increases strongly with latitudinal range centroid and secondarily with hardiness and decreases weakly with longitudinal range centroid. Hence, European tree species ranges appear strongly controlled by geographical dispersal constraints on post-glacial expansion as well as climate. Consequently, we expect European tree species to show only limited tracking of near-future climate changes.},

However species competition is a consistently missing variable in Species Distribution Modelling (SDM). This study presents results of our attempt to incorporate species competition in SDMs. We used a suit of predictor variables including Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), as well as distance from roads, settlements and water, fire frequency and distance from the nearest herbivore sighting (of selected herbivores) to model individual habitat preferences of five grazer species (buffalo, warthog, waterbuck, wildebeest and zebra) with the Ensemble SDM algorithm for Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe. Our results showed that distance from the nearest animal sighting (a proxy for competition among grazers) was the best predictor of the potential distribution of buffalo, wildebeest and zebra but the second best predictor for warthog and waterbuck. Our findings provide evidence to that competition is an important predictor of grazer species’ potential distribution. These findings suggest that species distribution modelling that neglects species competition may be inadequate in explaining the potential distribution of species. Therefore our findings encourage the inclusion of competition in SDM as well as potentially igniting discussions that may lead to improving the predictive power of future SDM efforts.},

	abstract = {Habitat models are tools for understanding the relationship between cetaceans and their environment, from which patterns of the animals’ space use can be inferred and management strategies developed. Can working with space use alone be sufficient for management, when habitat cannot be modeled? Here, we analyzed cetacean sightings data collected from small boat surveys off the coast of Oman between 2000 and 2003. The waters off Oman are used by the Endangered Arabian Sea population of humpback whales. Our data were collected primarily for photo-identification, using a haphazard sampling regime, either in areas where humpback whales were thought to be relatively abundant, or in areas that were logistically easy to survey. This leads to spatially autocorrelated data that are not amenable to analysis using standard approaches. We used quasi-Poisson generalized linear models and semi-parametric spatial filtering to assess the distribution of humpback and Bryde’s whales in 3 areas off Oman relative to 3 simple physiographic variables in a survey grid. Our analysis focused on the spatial eigenvector filtering of models, coupled with the spatial distribution of model residuals, rather than just on model predictions. Spatial eigenvector filtering accounts for spatial autocorrelation in models, allowing inference to be made regarding the relative importance of particular areas. As an exemplar of this approach, we demonstrate that the Dhofar coast of southern Oman is important habitat for the Arabian Sea population of humpback whales. We also suggest how conservation planning for mitigating impacts on humpback whales off the Dhofar coast could start.},

Robustness was equated with the strength, over a range of models, of the linear and monotonic (rank-order) relationship between the compositional dissimilarities and the corresponding Euclidean distances between sites measured in the ecological space. The range of models reflected different assumptions about species' response curve shape, sampling pattern of sites, noise level of the data, species' interactions, trends in total site abundance, and beta diversity of gradients. The Kulczynski, Bray-Curtis and Relativized Manhattan measures were found to have not only a robust monotonic relationship with ecological distance, but also a robust linear (proportional) relationship until ecological distances became large. Less robust measures included Chord distance, Kendall's coefficient, Chisquared distance, Manhattan distance, and Euclidean distance.},

	abstract = {Spatial analog techniques consist in identifying locations whose historical climate is similar to the anticipated future climate at a reference location. In the process of identifying analogs, one key step is the quantiﬁcation of the dissimilarity between two climates separated in time and space, which involves the choice of a metric. In this study, six a priori suitable metrics are described (the standardized Euclidean distance, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic, the nearest-neighbor distance, the Zech–Aslan energy statistic, the Friedman–Rafsky runs statistic, and the Kullback–Leibler divergence) and criteria are proposed and investigated in an attempt to identify the best metric for selecting spatial analogs. The case study involves the use of numerical simulations performed with the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM, version 4.2.3), from which three annual indicators (total precipitation, heating degree-days, and cooling degree-days) are calculated over 30-yr periods (1971–2000 and 2041–70). It is found that the six metrics identify comparable analog regions at a relatively large scale but that best analogs may differ substantially. For best analogs, it is shown that the uncertainty stemming from the metric choice does not generally exceed that stemming from the simulation or model choice. On the basis of the set of criteria considered in this study, the Zech–Aslan energy statistic stands out as the most recommended metric for analog studies, whereas the Friedman–Rafsky runs statistic is the least recommended.},

	abstract = {White clover is polymorphic for cyanogenesis (HCN production after tissue damage), and this herbivore defence polymorphism has served as a classic model for studying adaptive variation. The cyanogenic phenotype requires two interacting biochemical components; the presence ⁄ absence of each component is controlled by a simple Mendelian gene (Ac ⁄ ac and Li ⁄ li). Climate-associated cyanogenesis clines occur in both native (Eurasian) and introduced populations worldwide, with cyanogenic plants predominating in warmer locations. Moreover, previous studies have suggested that epistatic selection may act within populations to maintain cyanogenic (AcLi) plants and acyanogenic plants that lack both components (acli plants) at the expense of plants possessing a single component (Acli and acLi plants). Here, we examine the roles of selection, gene flow and demography in the evolution of a latitudinal cyanogenesis cline in introduced North American populations. Using 1145 plants sampled across a 1650 km transect, we determine the distribution of cyanogenesis variation across the central United States and investigate whether clinal variation is adaptive or an artefact of population introduction history. We also test for the evidence of epistatic selection. We detect a clear latitudinal cline, with cyanogenesis frequencies increasing from 11\% to 86\% across the transect. Population structure analysis using nine microsatellite loci indicates that the cline is adaptive and not a by-product of demographic history. However, we find no evidence for epistatic selection within populations. Our results provide strong evidence for rapid adaptive evolution in these introduced populations, and they further suggest that the mechanisms maintaining adaptive variation may vary among populations of a species.},

	abstract = {Niche-based models calibrated in the native range by relating species observations to climatic variables are commonly used to predict the potential spatial extent of speciesÕ invasion. This climate matching approach relies on the assumption that invasive species conserve their climatic niche in the invaded ranges. We test this assumption by analysing the climatic niche spaces of Spotted Knapweed in western North America and Europe. We show with robust cross-continental data that a shift of the observed climatic niche occurred between native and non-native ranges, providing the ﬁrst empirical evidence that an invasive species can occupy climatically distinct niche spaces following its introduction into a new area. The models fail to predict the current invaded distribution, but correctly predict areas of introduction. Climate matching is thus a useful approach to identify areas at risk of introduction and establishment of newly or not-yet-introduced neophytes, but may not predict the full extent of invasions.},

	abstract = {The process of biological invasion exposes a species to novel pressures, in terms of both the environments it encounters and the evolutionary consequences of range expansion. Several invaders have been shown to exhibit rapid evolutionary changes in response to those pressures, thus providing robust opportunities to clarify the processes at work during rapid phenotypic transitions. The accelerating pace of invasion of cane toads (Rhinella marina) in tropical Australia during its 80-year history has been well characterized at the phenotypic level, including common-garden experiments that demonstrate heritability of several dispersal-relevant traits. Individuals from the invasion front (and their progeny) show distinctive changes in morphology, physiology and behaviour that, in combination, result in far more rapid dispersal than is true of conspeciﬁcs from longcolonized areas. The extensive body of work on cane toad ecology enables us to place into context studies of the genetic basis of these traits. Our analyses of differential gene expression from toads from both ends of this invasion-history transect reveal substantial upregulation of many genes, notably those involved in metabolism and cellular repair. Clearly, then, the dramatically rapid phenotypic evolution of cane toads in Australia has been accompanied by substantial shifts in gene expression, suggesting that this system is well suited to investigating the genetic underpinnings of invasiveness.},

	abstract = {Despite being identified as a driver of mobile predator aggregations (hotspots) in both marine and terrestrial environments, topographic complexity has long remained a challenging concept for scientists to visualise and a difficult parameter to estimate. It is only with the advent of high-speed computers and the recent popularisation of geographical information systems (GIS) that terrain attributes have begun to be quantitatively measured in three-dimensional space and related to wildlife dynamics, making the well-established field of geomorphometry (or ‘digital terrain modelling’) a discipline of growing appeal to biologists. Although a diverse array of numerical metrics is now available to describe the shape, geometry and physical properties of natural habitats, few of these are known to, or adequately used by, ecologists. In this review, we examine the nature and usage of 56 geomorphometrics extracted from the ecological modelling literature over a period of 32 years (1979–2011). We show that, in studies of mobile predators, numerous topographic variables have largely been overlooked in favour of single basic metrics that do not, on their own, fully capture the complexity of continuous landscapes. Based on a simulation approach, we assess the redundancy and correlation structure of these metrics and demonstrate that a majority are highly collinear. We highlight a suite of 7–8 complementary metrics which best explain topographic patterns across a bathymetric grid of the west Australian seafloor, and contend that field and analytical protocols should prioritise variables of these types, particularly when the responses of predator populations to physical habitat features are of interest. We suggest that prominent structures such as canyons, seamounts or mountain chains can serve as useful proxies for predator hotspots, especially in remote locations where access to high-resolution biological data is often limited.},

However, due to their deep-living mode of life, their cosmopolitan distribution and our limited knowledge about their main prey species, the task has proved very difficult. This paper reviews studies of Sperm Whale distribution and the factors controlling it. The conclusions of these studies are very equivocal and often appear to contradict one another. It is suggested that this apparent confusion is mainly due to poorly defined spatial and temporal scales, the use of only one scale in most studies and the absence of consideration of the spatial and temporal scales at which relevant oceanographic processes occur. It is concluded that multiscale studies, covering the scales of oceanographic process, are needed to obtain a better understanding of Sperm Whale distribution.},

	abstract = {Sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus habitat preferences are still poorly understood in the Mediterranean, despite the population being classified as ‘Endangered’ by the IUCN. Techniques to make the best use of multiple data sources are important in improving this situation. This work provides a detailed evaluation of sperm whale distribution and habitat use around the Balearic Islands using a novel analytical framework that combines transect and follow data while accounting for any autocorrelation present. During dedicated research cruises (2003 to 2008), sperm whales were located by listening at regular intervals along a search track and subsequently followed acoustically. Sperm whales were encountered 56 times and followed for periods ranging from a few hours to 3 d. Logistic Generalized Additive Models were used to model the probability of whale presence across the study area as a function of environmental variables, and Generalized Estimating Equations were used to account for autocorrelation. The results suggest that sperm whales do not use the region uniformly and that topography plays a key role in shaping their distribution. Moreover, solitary individuals were found to use the habitat differently from groups. This segregation appeared to be driven by water temperature and might reflect different needs or intraspecific competition. By shedding light on sperm whale habitat preference in such a critical area, this study represents an important step towards the implementation of conservation measures for this population.},

We analyzed data collected from research surveys and whale-watching activities during summer months from 2004 to 2007. The dataset encompassed 147 Cuvier’s beaked whale sightings and 52 sperm whale sightings. We defined and applied a post hoc workflow to the data, to minimize false absence bias arising from the unique ecology of the species and the lack of a dedicated sampling design. We calculated a novel topographic predictor, distance from the canyon axis, as a covariate for use in the habitat model. Given the complex topography of the area, the analysis was performed on a high-resolution spatial grid (1 km). Our methods allowed effective use of the non-dedicated sampling dataset for building habitat models of elusive and cryptic species (Cuvier’s beaked whale final model sensitivity = 0.88 and specificity = 0.84; sperm whale final model sensitivity = 0.65 and specificity = 0.77). The GAM results confirmed the preference for submarine canyons for both species and also highlighted the importance of the deeper portion of the Ligurian basin, especially for Cuvier’s beaked whale. Habitat overlap nevertheless is resolved by a well-defined spatial partitioning of the area, with sperm whale occupying the western part and Cuvier’s beaked whale the central and eastern parts.},

The dynamic nature of oceanographic processes and the wide-ranging behavior of many marine vertebrates create further difﬁculties, as distribution data must incorporate both the spatial and temporal dimensions. Cetaceans play an essential role in structuring and maintaining marine ecosystems and face increasing threats from human activities. The Azores holds a high diversity of cetaceans but the information about spatial and temporal patterns of distribution for this marine megafauna group in the region is still very limited. To tackle this issue, we created monthly predictive cetacean distribution maps for spring and summer months, using data collected by the Azores Fisheries Observer Programme between 2004 and 2009. We then combined the individual predictive maps to obtain species richness maps for the same period. Our results reﬂect a great heterogeneity in distribution among species and within species among different months. This heterogeneity reﬂects a contrasting inﬂuence of oceanographic processes on the distribution of cetacean species. However, some persistent areas of increased species richness could also be identiﬁed from our results. We argue that policies aimed at effectively protecting cetaceans and their habitats must include the principle of dynamic ocean management coupled with other area-based management such as marine spatial planning.},

Many long-established introductions harbour high genetic diversity, raising the possibility that multiple introductions of genetic material catalyze adaptation and ⁄ or the evolution of invasiveness. Studies of nascent invasions are rare but crucial for understanding whether genetic diversity facilitates population expansion. We explore variation and evolution in founder populations of the invasive shrub Hypericum canariense. We find that these introductions have experienced large reductions in genetic diversity, but that increased growth and a latitudinal cline in flowering phenology have nevertheless evolved. These life history changes are consistent with predictions for invasive plants. Our results highlight the potential for even genetically depauperate founding populations to adapt and evolve invasive patters of spread.},

They rely on a proper understanding of how environmental drivers determine species occurrence patterns. This understanding is usually derived from an analysis of the species’ present distribution by statistical means (species distribution models). Projections based on species distribution models make several assumptions (such as constancy of limiting factors, no evolutionary adaptation to drivers, global dispersal), some of which are ecologically untenable. Also, methodological issues muddy the waters (e.g. spatial autocorrelation, collinearity of drivers). Here, I review the main shortcomings of species distribution models and species distribution projections, identify limits to their use and open a perspective on how to overcome some current obstacles. As a consequence, I caution biogeographers against making projections too lightheartedly and conservation ecologists and policy makers to be aware that there are several unresolved problems.},

	abstract = {Species migration in response to warming temperatures is expected to lead to ‘biotic attrition,’ or loss of local diversity, in areas where the number of species emigrating or going locally extinct exceeds the number immigrating. Biotic attrition is predicted be especially severe in the low-lying hot tropics since elevated temperatures may surpass the observed tolerances of most extant species. It is possible, however, that the estimated temperature niches of many species are inaccurate and truncated with respect to their true tolerances due to the absence of hotter areas under current global climate. If so, these species will be capable of persisting in some areas where future temperatures exceed current temperatures, reducing rates of biotic attrition. Here, we use natural history collections data to estimate the realized thermal niches of 42000 plant species from the tropical forests of South America. In accord with the truncation hypothesis, we ﬁnd that the thermal niches of species from hot lowland areas are several degrees narrower than the thermal niches of species from cooler areas. We estimate rates of biotic attrition for South American tropical forests due to temperature increases ranging from 1 to 5 1C, and under two niche assumptions. The ﬁrst is that the observed thermal niches truly reﬂect the plant’s tolerances and that the reduction in niche breadth is due to increased specialization. The second is that lowland species have the same mean thermal niche breadth as nonlowland and nonequatorial species. The differences between these two models are dramatic. For example, using observed thermal niches we predict an almost complete loss of plant diversity in most South American tropical forests due to a 5 1C temperature increase, but correcting for possible niche truncation we estimate that most forests will retain 450–70\% of their current species richness. The different predictions highlight the importance of using fundamental vs. realized niches in predicting the responses of species to global climate change.},

Yet, these models are often presented without fully examining or explaining the caveats for their proper use and interpretation and are often implemented without understanding the limitations and assumptions of the model being used. We describe common pitfalls, assumptions, and caveats of correlative species distribution models to help novice users and end users better interpret these models. Four primary caveats corresponding to different phases of the modeling process, each with supporting documentation and examples, include: (1) all sampling data are incomplete and potentially biased; (2) predictor variables must capture distribution constraints; (3) no single model works best for all species, in all areas, at all spatial scales, and over time; and (4) the results of species distribution models should be treated like a hypothesis to be tested and validated with additional sampling and modeling in an iterative process.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in building predictive models of species distributions over large geographic areas. As larger areas are modelled, however, it is highly likely that heterogeneity in the predictors variable increases and that areas are included where animals respond to habitats in different ways, for example, due to social status. These effects (spatial non-stationary) may weaken model performance. This paper explores whether data partitioning prior to analysis can improve the fit of models and provide ecological insight into distribution patterns. Data on three bird species were modelled for the whole of Spain at 1 km2 resolution using logistic regression analysis. Data were partitioned into geographic quarters, concentric rings around the centroid of the distribution, and into random samples for comparison. In all cases, data partitioning produced better models as assessed by Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) statistics than analysis of the global data set. Inclusion of latitude and longitude improved the global models only when added as smoothed splines but produced different probabilities to the partitioned data. Geographic partitioning is a very crude local modelling approach and we suggest that some form of geographically-weighted regression could offer the best solution to large-scale modelling but is computationally intensive on Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data. It is concluded that simple partitioning by geographic quarters may detect spatial non-stationary and alert the modeller to possible problems; that partitioning into more novel arrangements may be used to test ecological hypotheses; and that data should not be partitioned spatially to build and test models if non-stationary is suspected. \# 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used for extrapolation, or predicting suitable regions for species under new geographic or temporal scenarios. However, SDM predictions may be prone to errors if species are not at equilibrium with climatic conditions in the current range and if training samples are not representative. Here the controversial ‘‘Pleistocene rewilding’’ proposal was used as a novel example to address some of the challenges of extrapolating modeled species-climate relationships outside of current ranges. Climatic suitability for three proposed proxy species (Asian elephant, African cheetah and African lion) was extrapolated to the American southwest and Great Plains using Maxent, a machinelearning species distribution model. Similar models were fit for Oryx gazella, a species native to Africa that has naturalized in North America, to test model predictions. To overcome biases introduced by contracted modern ranges and limited occurrence data, random pseudo-presence points generated from modern and historical ranges were used for model training. For all species except the oryx, models of climatic suitability fit to training data from historical ranges produced larger areas of predicted suitability in North America than models fit to training data from modern ranges. Four naturalized oryx populations in the American southwest were correctly predicted with a generous model threshold, but none of these locations were predicted with a more stringent threshold. In general, the northern Great Plains had low climatic suitability for all focal species and scenarios considered, while portions of the southern Great Plains and American southwest had low to intermediate suitability for some species in some scenarios. The results suggest that the use of historical, in addition to modern, range information and randomly sampled pseudo-presence points may improve model accuracy. This has implications for modeling range shifts of organisms in response to climate change.},

	abstract = {Reliable abundance estimates for species are fundamental in ecology, fisheries, and conservation. Consequently, predictive models able to provide reliable estimates for un- or poorly-surveyed locations would prove a valuable tool for management. Based on commonly used environmental and physical predictors, we developed predictive models of total fish abundance and of abundance by fish family for ten representative taxonomic families for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) using multiple temporal scenarios. We then tested if models developed for the GBR (reference system) could predict fish abundances at Ningaloo Reef (NR; target system), i.e., if these GBR models could be successfully transferred to NR. Models of abundance by fish family resulted in improved performance (e.g., 44.1\% {\textless} R2 {\textless} 50.6\% for Acanthuridae) compared to total fish abundance (9\% {\textless} R2 {\textless} 18.6\%). However, in contrast with previous transferability obtained for similar models for fish species richness from the GBR to NR, transferability for these fish abundance models was poor. When compared with observations of fish abundance collected in NR, our transferability results had low validation scores (R2 {\textless} 6\%, p {\textgreater} 0.05). High spatio-temporal variability of patterns in fish abundance at the family and population levels in both reef systems likely affected the transferability of these models. Inclusion of additional predictors with potential direct effects on abundance, such as local fishing effort or topographic complexity, may improve transferability of fish abundance models. However, observations of these local-scale predictors are often not available, and might thereby hinder studies on model transferability and its usefulness for conservation planning and management.},

	abstract = {Two major mechanisms have been proposed to explain the ability of introduced populations to colonize over large habitat gradients, despite signiﬁcant population bottlenecks during introduction: (1) Broad environmental tolerance—successful invaders possess life history traits that confer superior colonizing ability and/or phenotypic plasticity, allowing acclimation to a wide range of habitats. (2) Local adaptation—successful invaders rapidly adapt to local selective pressures. However, even with bottlenecks, many introduced species exhibit surprisingly high levels of genetic variation and thus the potential for evolutionary increases in invasive traits and plasticity. Here we assess the invasive potential of Tamarix ramosissima, by examining the degree of genetic differentiation within and among populations from the latitudinal extremes of its introduced range. Using growth chamber experiments we examined ecologically important variation in seedlings, both in trait means and their reaction norms across temperature environments. Although we found no genetic variation for gas exchange traits, within or among populations, we did ﬁnd signiﬁcant genetic variation for growth traits, both in the trait means and in the degree of plasticity in these traits. Northern ecotypes invested more in roots relative to southern ecotypes but only under low temperatures. Both ecotypes increased shoot investment in warm temperatures. Increased root investment in cold temperatures by northern ecotypes may increase their ﬁrst winter survival. Genetic differences in seedling root investment may contribute to the ability of this species to successfully tolerate and invade a broader latitudinal range. Our data support a model in which both plasticity and adaptive evolution can contribute to the invasive potential of introduced species.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly proposed to support conservation decision making. However, evidence of SDMs supporting solutions for on-ground conservation problems is still scarce in the scientiﬁc literature. Here, we show that successful examples exist but are still largely hidden in the grey literature, and thus less accessible for analysis and learning. Furthermore, the decision framework within which SDMs are used is rarely made explicit. Using case studies from biological invasions, identiﬁcation of critical habitats, reserve selection and translocation of endangered species, we propose that SDMs may be tailored to suit a range of decision-making contexts when used within a structured and transparent decision-making process. To construct appropriate SDMs to more effectively guide conservation actions, modellers need to better understand the decision process, and decision makers need to provide feedback to modellers regarding the actual use of SDMs to support conservation decisions. This could be facilitated by individuals or institutions playing the role of ‘translators’ between modellers and decision makers. We encourage species distribution modellers to get involved in real decision-making processes that will beneﬁt from their technical input; this strategy has the potential to better bridge theory and practice, and contribute to improve both scientiﬁc knowledge and conservation outcomes.},

	abstract = {Habitat models are tools for understanding the relationship between cetaceans and their environment, from which patterns of the animals’ space use can be inferred and management strategies developed. Can working with space use alone be sufficient for management, when habitat cannot be modeled? Here, we analyzed cetacean sightings data collected from small boat surveys off the coast of Oman between 2000 and 2003. The waters off Oman are used by the Endangered Arabian Sea population of humpback whales. Our data were collected primarily for photo-identification, using a haphazard sampling regime, either in areas where humpback whales were thought to be relatively abundant, or in areas that were logistically easy to survey. This leads to spatially autocorrelated data that are not amenable to analysis using standard approaches. We used quasi-Poisson generalized linear models and semi-parametric spatial filtering to assess the distribution of humpback and Bryde’s whales in 3 areas off Oman relative to 3 simple physiographic variables in a survey grid. Our analysis focused on the spatial eigenvector filtering of models, coupled with the spatial distribution of model residuals, rather than just on model predictions. Spatial eigenvector filtering accounts for spatial autocorrelation in models, allowing inference to be made regarding the relative importance of particular areas. As an exemplar of this approach, we demonstrate that the Dhofar coast of southern Oman is important habitat for the Arabian Sea population of humpback whales. We also suggest how conservation planning for mitigating impacts on humpback whales off the Dhofar coast could start.},

They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reﬂect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is inﬂuenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

We explored different evaluation metrics based on independent testing data using the Darwin’s Fox (Lycalopex fulvipes) as a detailed case in point. Six ecological niche models (ENMs; generalized linear models, boosted regression trees, Maxent, GARP, multivariable kernel density estimation, and NicheA) were explored and tested using six evaluation metrics (partial ROC, Akaike information criterion, omission rate, cumulative binomial probability), including two novel metrics to quantify model extrapolation versus interpolation (E-­space index I) and extent of extrapolation versus Jaccard similarity (E-­space index II). Different ENMs showed diverse and mixed performance, depending on the evaluation metric used. Because ENMs performed differently according to the evaluation metric employed, model selection should be based on the data available, assumptions necessary, and the particular research question. The typical ROC AUC evaluation approach should be discontinued when only presence data are available, and evaluations in environmental dimensions should be adopted as part of the toolkit of ENM researchers. Our results suggest that selecting Maxent ENM based solely on previous reports of its performance is a questionable practice. Instead, model comparisons, including diverse algorithms and parameterizations, should be the sine qua non for every study using ecological niche modeling. ENM evaluations should be developed using metrics that assess desired model characteristics instead of single measurement of fit between model and data. The metrics proposed herein that assess model performance in environmental space (i.e., E-­space indices I and II) may complement current methods for ENM evaluation.},

Robustness was equated with the strength, over a range of models, of the linear and monotonic (rank-order) relationship between the compositional dissimilarities and the corresponding Euclidean distances between sites measured in the ecological space. The range of models reflected different assumptions about species' response curve shape, sampling pattern of sites, noise level of the data, species' interactions, trends in total site abundance, and beta diversity of gradients. The Kulczynski, Bray-Curtis and Relativized Manhattan measures were found to have not only a robust monotonic relationship with ecological distance, but also a robust linear (proportional) relationship until ecological distances became large. Less robust measures included Chord distance, Kendall's coefficient, Chisquared distance, Manhattan distance, and Euclidean distance.},

Understanding species–h­ abitat relationships can improve the assessment of trends and distribution by explicitly allowing high-­resolution data on habitats to inform abundance estimation and the identification of protected areas. In this study, we aggregated an unprecedented set of survey data of a marine top predator, the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), collected in the UK (SCANS II, Dogger Bank), Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark, to develop seasonal habitat-­based density models for the central and southern North Sea. Visual survey data were collected over 9 yr (2005–2013) by means of dedicated line-­transect surveys, taking into account the proportion of missed sightings. Generalized additive models of porpoise density were fitted to 156,630 km of on-e­ ffort survey data with 14,356 sightings of porpoise groups. Selected predictors included static and dynamic variables, such as depth, distance to shore and to sandeel (Ammodytes spp.) grounds, sea surface temperature (SST), proxies for fronts, and day length. Day length and the spatial distribution of daily SST proved to be good proxies for “season,” allowing predictions in both space and time. The density models captured seasonal distribution shifts of porpoises across international boundaries. By combining the large-­scale international SCANS II survey with the more frequent, small-s­ cale national surveys, it has been possible to provide seasonal maps that will be used to assist the EU Habitats and Marine Strategy Framework Directives in effectively assessing the conservation status of harbor porpoises. Moreover, our results can facilitate the identification of regions where human activities and disturbances are likely to impact the population and are especially relevant for marine spatial planning, which requires accurate fine-­scale maps of species distribution to assess risks of increasing human activities at sea.},

	abstract = {Spatial analog techniques consist in identifying locations whose historical climate is similar to the anticipated future climate at a reference location. In the process of identifying analogs, one key step is the quantiﬁcation of the dissimilarity between two climates separated in time and space, which involves the choice of a metric. In this study, six a priori suitable metrics are described (the standardized Euclidean distance, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic, the nearest-neighbor distance, the Zech–Aslan energy statistic, the Friedman–Rafsky runs statistic, and the Kullback–Leibler divergence) and criteria are proposed and investigated in an attempt to identify the best metric for selecting spatial analogs. The case study involves the use of numerical simulations performed with the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM, version 4.2.3), from which three annual indicators (total precipitation, heating degree-days, and cooling degree-days) are calculated over 30-yr periods (1971–2000 and 2041–70). It is found that the six metrics identify comparable analog regions at a relatively large scale but that best analogs may differ substantially. For best analogs, it is shown that the uncertainty stemming from the metric choice does not generally exceed that stemming from the simulation or model choice. On the basis of the set of criteria considered in this study, the Zech–Aslan energy statistic stands out as the most recommended metric for analog studies, whereas the Friedman–Rafsky runs statistic is the least recommended.},

We compiled a geo-spatial database of published data on cetacean abundance from dedicated visual line-transect surveys and encoded .1100 abundance estimates for 47 species from 430 surveys conducted worldwide from 1975–2005. Our subsequent analyses revealed large spatial, temporal and taxonomic variability and gaps in survey coverage. With the exception of Antarctic waters, survey coverage was biased toward the northern hemisphere, especially US and northern European waters. Overall, ,25\% of the world’s ocean surface was surveyed and only 6\% had been covered frequently enough (\$5 times) to allow trend estimation. Almost half the global survey effort, defined as total area (km2) covered by all survey study areas across time, was concentrated in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP). Neither the number of surveys conducted nor the survey effort had increased in recent years. Across species, an average of 10\% of a species’ predicted range had been covered by at least one survey, but there was considerable variation among species. With the exception of three delphinid species, ,1\% of all species’ ranges had been covered frequently enough for trend analysis. Sperm whales emerged from our analyses as a relatively data-rich species. This is a notoriously difficult species to survey visually, and we use this as an example to illustrate the challenges of using available data from line-transect surveys for the detection of trends or for spatial planning. We propose field and analytical methods to fill in data gaps to improve cetacean conservation efforts.},

However species competition is a consistently missing variable in Species Distribution Modelling (SDM). This study presents results of our attempt to incorporate species competition in SDMs. We used a suit of predictor variables including Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), as well as distance from roads, settlements and water, fire frequency and distance from the nearest herbivore sighting (of selected herbivores) to model individual habitat preferences of five grazer species (buffalo, warthog, waterbuck, wildebeest and zebra) with the Ensemble SDM algorithm for Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe. Our results showed that distance from the nearest animal sighting (a proxy for competition among grazers) was the best predictor of the potential distribution of buffalo, wildebeest and zebra but the second best predictor for warthog and waterbuck. Our findings provide evidence to that competition is an important predictor of grazer species’ potential distribution. These findings suggest that species distribution modelling that neglects species competition may be inadequate in explaining the potential distribution of species. Therefore our findings encourage the inclusion of competition in SDM as well as potentially igniting discussions that may lead to improving the predictive power of future SDM efforts.},

Quantifying range ﬁlling (R/P) as realized/potential range size ratios using bioclimatic envelope modelling we find mean R/P ¼ 38.3\% (±30.3\% SD). Many European tree species naturalize extensively outside their native ranges, providing support for interpreting the many low R/Ps as primarily reflecting dispersal limitation. R/P increases strongly with latitudinal range centroid and secondarily with hardiness and decreases weakly with longitudinal range centroid. Hence, European tree species ranges appear strongly controlled by geographical dispersal constraints on post-glacial expansion as well as climate. Consequently, we expect European tree species to show only limited tracking of near-future climate changes.},

	abstract = {Cetacean–habitat modeling, although still in the early stages of development, represents a potentially powerful tool for predicting cetacean distributions and understanding the ecological processes determining these distributions. Marine ecosystems vary temporally on diel to decadal scales and spatially on scales from several meters to 1000s of kilometers. Many cetacean species are wideranging and respond to this variability by changes in distribution patterns. Cetacean–habitat models have already been used to incorporate this variability into management applications, including improvement of abundance estimates, development of marine protected areas, and understanding cetacean–fisheries interactions. We present a review of the development of cetacean–habitat models, organized according to the primary steps involved in the modeling process. Topics covered include purposes for which cetacean–habitat models are developed, scale issues in marine ecosystems, cetacean and habitat data collection, descriptive and statistical modeling techniques, model selection, and model evaluation. To date, descriptive statistical techniques have been used to explore cetacean–habitat relationships for selected species in specific areas; the numbers of species and geographic areas examined using computationally intensive statistic modeling techniques are considerably less, and the development of models to test specific hypotheses about the ecological processes determining cetacean distributions has just begun. Future directions in cetacean–habitat modeling span a wide range of possibilities, from development of basic modeling techniques to addressing important ecological questions.},

	abstract = {Research into the effects of scale on cetacean–habitat relationships is limited and has produced ambiguous results. We explored the effects of spatial resolution (a component of scale) on dolphin–habitat models using 4 yr of data collected in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP). We developed generalized additive models of dolphin–habitat relationships for 4 species at 6 spatial resolutions using oceanographic and geographic habitat variables. For all species, the ecological patterns in the models built at the different resolutions were similar: the same variables frequently occurred at multiple resolutions and had similar functional forms, and maps of predicted distributions identified similar high and low density regions. Additionally, interannual habitat variability, which is most likely related to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, had a greater impact on the predictive power of dolphin–habitat models than spatial resolution. Although it is common to find scale dependence in species–habitat relationships, domains of scale exist in which ecological patterns do not change. The absence of scale dependence in the models for the 4 dolphin species suggests that resolutions from 2 to 120 km occur within a single domain of scale in the ETP. This domain of scale may be determined by the physical oceanography of the ETP, which is generally defined by large-scale processes. Although resolutions from 2 to 120 km appear to occur within a domain of scale, building models at the larger resolutions we investigated may reduce the noise in the data due to false absences.},

Improving the knowledge of the distribution and abundance of this poorly known group is an essential prerequisite to inform mitigation strategies seeking to minimize their spatial and temporal overlap with human activities. We provide for the ﬁrst time abundance estimates for ﬁve deep diving cetacean species (sperm whale, long-ﬁnned pilot whale, northern bottlenose whale, Cuvier's beaked whale and Sowerby's beaked whale) using data from three dedicated cetacean sighting surveys that covered the oceanic and shelf waters of the North-East Atlantic. Density surface modelling was used to obtain model-based estimates of abundance and to explore the physical and biological characteristics of the habitat used by these species. Distribution of all species was found to be signiﬁcantly related to depth, distance from the 2000m depth contour, the contour index (a measure of variability in the seabed) and sea surface temperature. Predicted distribution maps also suggest that there is little spatial overlap between these species. Our results represent the best abundance estimates for deep-diving whales in the North-East Atlantic, predict areas of high density during summer and constitute important baseline information to guide future risk assessments of human activities on these species, evaluate potential spatial and temporal trends and inform EU Directives and future conservation eﬀorts.},

	abstract = {Generalized linear and generalized additive habitat models were used to predict cetacean densities for 10 species in an 818 000 km2 area off California. The performance of models built with remotely sensed oceanic data was compared to that of models built with in situ measurements. Cetacean sighting data were collected by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center on 4 systematic line-transect surveys during the summer and fall of 1991, 1993, 1996, and 2001. Predictor variables included temporally dynamic, remotely sensed environmental variables (sea surface temperature and measures of its variance) and more static geographical variables (water depth, bathymetric slope, and a categorical variable representing oceanic zone). The explanatory and predictive power of different spatial and temporal resolutions of satellite data were examined and included in the models for each of the 10 species. Alternative models were built using in situ analogs for sea surface temperature and its variance. The remotely sensed and in situ models with the highest predictive ability were selected based on a pseudo-jackknife cross validation procedure. Environmental predictors included in the final models varied by species, but, for each species, overall explanatory power was similar between the remotely sensed and in situ models. Cetacean–habitat models developed using satellite data at 8 d temporal resolution and from 5 to 35 km spatial resolution were shown to have predictive ability that generally met or exceeded models developed with analogous in situ data. This suggests that the former could be an effective tool for resource managers to develop near real-time predictions of cetacean density.},

	abstract = {Species−environment models are increasingly recognized as valuable tools for assessing protected species distributions and developing measures to reduce or avoid adverse impacts. Cetacean−habitat models can provide a finer spatial resolution than traditional abundance estimates, but model predictions are generally based on past observations rather than current or projected ocean conditions. We present and evaluate methods for near real-time and forecast models of cetacean distribution based on remotely sensed and modeled oceanographic data. Recent advancements in processing satellite-derived data (e.g. microwave/infrared blended sea surface temperature [SST] products) have virtually eliminated data gaps due to cloud cover, allowing short-term forecasts based on single-day snapshots of oceanic conditions. Ocean circulation models (e.g. the Regional Ocean Modeling System [ROMS]) allow medium-range forecast predictions of oceanic variables, including SST, chlorophyll and salinity. We developed habitat models for striped dolphin, fin whale and Dall’s porpoise using line-transect data collected from July to November 1991−2005 in the California Current Ecosystem. We incorporated daily blended SST data and monthly ROMS SST forecasts as input variables to predict relative species density in 2008. Forecast ability was assessed by the models’ ranked predictions across 8 geographic strata, and by visual inspection of predicted and observed distributions. For all 3 species, there was a significant correlation between model predictions using daily blended SSTs and actual survey observations (p {\textless} 0.05). Longer-term (3−4 mo) predictions also showed good concordance with observed sighting locations. Cetacean−habitat models that allow weekly to monthly forecasting of cetacean abundance can greatly enhance short-term decision-making and advanced mitigation planning.},

	abstract = {Temporal variability in species distribution remains a major source of uncertainty in managing protected marine species, particularly in ecosystems with significant seasonal or interannual variation, such as the California Current Ecosystem (CCE). Spatially explicit species–habitat models have become valuable tools for decision makers assisting in the development and implementation of measures to reduce adverse impacts (e.g. from fishery bycatch, ship strikes, anthropogenic sound), but such models are often not available for all seasons of interest. Broadscale migratory patterns of many of the large whale species are well known, while seasonal distribution shifts of small cetaceans are typically less well understood. Within the CCE, species–habitat models have been developed based on 6 summer−fall surveys conducted during 1991 to 2008. We evaluated whether the between-year oceanographic variability can inform species predictions during winter−spring periods. Generalized additive models were developed to predict abundance of 4 cetacean species/genera known to have year-round occurrence in the CCE: common dolphins Delphinus spp., Pacific white-sided dolphin Lagenorhynchus obliquidens, northern right whale dolphin Lissodelphis borealis, and Dall’s porpoise Phocoenoides dalli. Predictor variables included a combination of temporally dynamic, remotely sensed environmental variables and geographically fixed variables. Across-season predictive ability was evaluated relative to aerial surveys conducted in winter−spring 1991 to 1992, using observed:predicted density ratios, nonparametric Spearman rank correlation tests, and visual inspection of predicted and observed distributions by species. Seasonal geographic patterns of species density were captured effectively for most species, although some model limitations were evident, particularly when the original summer−fall data did not adequately capture winter−spring habitat conditions.},

The primary sources of dynamic habitat data have been in situ and remotely sensed oceanic variables (both are considered “measured data”), but now ocean models can provide historical estimates and forecast predictions of relevant habitat variables such as temperature, salinity, and mixed layer depth. To assess the performance of modeled ocean data in species distribution models, we present a case study for cetaceans that compares models based on output from a data assimilative implementation of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) to those based on measured data. Speciﬁcally, we used seven years of cetacean line-transect survey data collected between 1991 and 2009 to develop predictive habitat-based models of cetacean density for 11 species in the California Current Ecosystem. Two different generalized additive models were compared: one built with a full suite of ROMS output and another built with a full suite of measured data. Model performance was assessed using the percentage of explained deviance, root mean squared error (RMSE), observed to predicted density ratios, and visual inspection of predicted and observed distributions. Predicted distribution patterns were similar for models using ROMS output and measured data, and showed good concordance between observed sightings and model predictions. Quantitative measures of predictive ability were also similar between model types, and RMSE values were almost identical. The overall demonstrated success of the ROMS-based models opens new opportunities for dynamic species management and biodiversity monitoring because ROMS output is available in near real time and can be forecast.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are important management tools for highly mobile marine species because they provide spatially and temporally explicit information on animal distribution. Two prevalent modeling frameworks used to develop SDMs for marine species are generalized additive models (GAMs) and boosted regression trees (BRTs), but comparative studies have rarely been conducted; most rely on presence-only data; and few have explored how features such as species distribution characteristics affect model performance. Since the majority of marine species BRTs have been used to predict habitat suitability, we first compared BRTs to GAMs that used presence/absence as the response variable. We then compared results from these habitat suitability models to GAMs that predict species density (animals per km2) because density models built with a subset of the data used here have previously received extensive validation. We compared both the explanatory power (i.e., model goodness of fit) and predictive power (i.e., performance on a novel dataset) of the GAMs and BRTs for a taxonomically diverse suite of cetacean species using a robust set of systematic survey data (1991–2014) within the California Current Ecosystem. Both BRTs and GAMs were successful at describing overall distribution patterns throughout the study area for the majority of species considered, but when predicting on novel data, the density GAMs exhibited substantially greater predictive power than both the presence/absence GAMs and BRTs, likely due to both the different response variables and fitting algorithms. Our results provide an improved understanding of some of the strengths and limitations of models developed using these two methods. These results can be used by modelers developing SDMs and resource managers tasked with the spatial management of marine species to determine the best modeling technique for their question of interest.},

Typically, however, such information is only available for broad geographic regions, e.g. the entire West Coast of the United States. We present species−habitat models that estimate finer scale cetacean densities within the eastern Pacific Ocean. The models were developed and validated for 22 species or species groups, based on 15 large-scale shipboard cetacean and ecosystem assessment surveys conducted in the temperate and tropical eastern Pacific during the period from 1986 to 2006. Model development included consideration of different modeling frameworks, spatial and temporal resolutions of input variables, and spatial interpolation techniques. For the final models, expected group encounter rate and group size were modeled separately, using generalized additive models, as functions of environmental predictors, including bathymetry, distance to shore or isobaths, sea surface temperature (SST), variance in SST, salinity, chlorophyll, and mixed-layer depth. Model selection was performed using cross-validation on novel data. Smoothed maps of species density (and variance therein) were created from the final models for the California Current Ecosystem and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. Model results were integrated into a web-interface that allows end-users to estimate densities for specified areas and provides fine-scale information for marine mammal assessments, monitoring, and mitigation.},

Studies of the abundance and distribution of cetaceans within these dynamic marine ecosystems have generally been patchy or conducted at coarse spatial and temporal scales, limiting their utility for pelagic conservation planning. Habitat-based density models provide a tool for identifying pelagic areas of importance to cetaceans, because model predictions are spatially explicit. In this study, we present habitat-based models of cetacean density that were developed and validated for the central North Pacific. Spatial predictions of cetacean densities and measures of uncertainty were derived based on data collected during 15 large-scale shipboard cetacean and ecosystem assessment surveys conducted from 1997 to 2012. We developed generalized additive models using static and remotely sensed dynamic habitat variables, including distance to land, sea-surface temperature (SST), standard deviation of SST, surface chlorophyll concentration, seasurface height (SSH), and SSH root-mean-square variation. The resulting models, developed using new grid-based prediction methods, provide finer scale information on the distribution and density of cetaceans than previously available. Habitat-based abundance estimates around Hawaii are similar to those derived from standard line-transect analyses of the same data and provide enhanced spatial resolution to inform management and conservation of pelagic cetacean species.},

Understanding species–habitat relationships can improve the assessment of trends and distribution by explicitly allowing high-resolution data on habitats to inform abundance estimation and the identification of protected areas. In this study, we aggregated an unprecedented set of survey data of a marine top predator, the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), collected in the UK (SCANS II, Dogger Bank), Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark, to develop seasonal habitat-based density models for the central and southern North Sea. Visual survey data were collected over 9 yr (2005–2013) by means of dedicated line-transect surveys, taking into account the proportion of missed sightings. Generalized additive models of porpoise density were fitted to 156,630 km of on-effort survey data with 14,356 sightings of porpoise groups. Selected predictors included static and dynamic variables, such as depth, distance to shore and to sandeel (Ammodytes spp.) grounds, sea surface temperature (SST), proxies for fronts, and day length. Day length and the spatial distribution of daily SST proved to be good proxies for “season,” allowing predictions in both space and time. The density models captured seasonal distribution shifts of porpoises across international boundaries. By combining the large-scale international SCANS II survey with the more frequent, small-scale national surveys, it has been possible to provide seasonal maps that will be used to assist the EU Habitats and Marine Strategy Framework Directives in effectively assessing the conservation status of harbor porpoises. Moreover, our results can facilitate the identification of regions where human activities and disturbances are likely to impact the population and are especially relevant for marine spatial planning, which requires accurate fine-scale maps of species distribution to assess risks of increasing human activities at sea.},

	abstract = {Harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena is the only cetacean species resident in the Baltic Sea. At least 2 different subpopulations occur in this area, with a presumed demarcation line in the western Baltic Sea. Aerial surveys were conducted during different seasons in the years 2002 to 2006, to obtain estimates of porpoise abundance for the southwestern Baltic. Within the survey area, 3 strata were defined. In total, 46 surveys were completed for these strata. Abundance estimates and corresponding confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each stratum separately for each survey. Density between areas varied seasonally and spatially, with the western study area (Kiel Bight) generally showing the highest density. Whenever all 3 strata were covered within 25 consecutive days, abundance for the overall survey area was calculated. Ten surveys met these criteria. Overall abundance in the western Baltic varied between surveys, with the lowest value in March 2003 (457 ind.; 95\% CI: 0 to 1632), and the highest estimate in May 2005 (4610 ind.; 95\% CI: 2259 to 9098). The results of all other surveys were in the range from 1352 to 2905 ind., with largely overlapping confidence intervals. Applying the only available bycatch estimates (which include no measure of precision) currently available for the German Baltic region, the percent of porpoise bycatch in the western Baltic lies within a range of 1.78 to 17.94\% of the local population. To increase the precision of bycatch rates, more detailed bycatch estimates for this region are needed. Nevertheless, the results indicate that bycatch is a major threat to harbour porpoises throughout the western Baltic Sea.},

	abstract = {The North Sea is one of the most heavily used shelf regions worldwide with a diversity of human impacts, including shipping, pollution, ﬁsheries, and offshore constructions. These stressors on the environment can have consequences for marine organisms, such as our study species, the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), which is regarded as a sentinel species and hence has a high conservation priority in the European Union (EU). As EU member states are obliged to monitor the population status, the present study aims to estimate trends in absolute harbor porpoise abundance in the German North Sea based on almost two decades of aerial surveys (2002–2019) using line-transect methodology. Furthermore, we were interested in trends in three Natura2000 Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), which include the harbor porpoise as designated feature. Trends were estimated for each SAC and two seasons (spring and summer) as well as the complete area of the German North Sea. For the trend analysis we applied a Bayesian framework to a series of replicated visual surveys, allowing to propagate the error structure of the original abundance estimates to the ﬁnal trend estimate and designed to deal with spatio-temporal heterogeneity and other sources of uncertainty. In general, harbor porpoise abundance decreased in northern areas and increased in the south, such as in the SAC Borkum Reef Ground. A particularly strong decline with a high probability (94.9\%) was detected in the core area and main reproduction site in summer, the SAC Sylt Outer Reef (−3.79\% per year). The overall trend for the German North Sea revealed a decrease in harbor porpoise abundance over the whole study period (−1.79\% per year) with high probability (95.1\%). The assessment of these trends in abundance based on systematic monitoring should now form the basis for adaptive management, especially in the SAC Sylt Outer Reef, where the underlying causes and drivers for the large decline remain unknown and deserve further investigation, also in a regional North Sea wide context.},

	abstract = {To date, most habitat models of cetaceans have relied on static and oceanographic covariates, and very few have related cetaceans directly to the distribution of their prey, as a result of the limited availability of prey data. By simulating the distribution of six functional micronekton groups between the surface and .1,000 m deep, the SEAPODYM model provides valuable insights into prey distributions. We used SEAPODYM outputs to investigate the habitat of three cetacean guilds with increasing energy requirements: sperm and beaked whales, Globicephalinae and Delphininae. We expected High Energy Requirements cetaceans to preferentially forage in habitats of high prey biomass and/or production, where they might easily meet their high energetic needs, and Low Energy Requirements cetaceans to forage in habitats of either high or low prey biomass and/or production. Cetacean sightings were collected from dedicated aerial surveys in the South West Indian Ocean (SWIO) and French Polynesia (FP). We examined cetacean densities in relation to simulated distributions of their potential prey using Generalised Additive Models and predicted their habitats in both regions. Results supported their known diving abilities, with Delphininae mostly related to prey present in the upper layers of the water column, and Globicephalinae and sperm and beaked whales also related to prey present in deeper layers. Explained deviances ranged from 9\% for sperm and beaked whales in the SWIO to 47\% for Globicephalinae in FP. Delphininae and Globicephalinae appeared to select areas where high prey biomass and/or production were available at shallow depths. In contrast, sperm and beaked whales showed less clear habitat selection. Using simulated prey distributions as predictors in cetacean habitat models is crucial to understand their strategies of habitat selection in the three dimensions of the ocean.},

	abstract = {Despite large efforts, datasets with few sightings are often available for rare species of marine megafauna that typically live at low densities. This paucity of data makes modelling the habitat of these taxa particularly challenging. We tested the predictive performance of different types of species distribution models fitted to decreasing numbers of sightings. Generalised additive models (GAMs) with three different residual distributions and the presence only model MaxEnt were tested on two megafauna case studies differing in both the number of sightings and ecological niches. From a dolphin (277 sightings) and an auk (1,455 sightings) datasets, we simulated rarity with a sighting thinning protocol by random sampling (without replacement) of a decreasing fraction of sightings. Better prediction of the distribution of a rarely sighted species occupying a narrow habitat (auk dataset) was expected compared to the distribution of a rarely sighted species occupying a broad habitat (dolphin dataset). We used the original datasets to set up a baseline model and fitted additional models on fewer sightings but keeping effort constant. Model predictive performance was assessed with mean squared error and area under the curve. Predictions provided by the models fitted to the thinned-out datasets were better than a homogeneous spatial distribution down to a threshold of approximately 30 sightings for a GAM with a Tweedie distribution and approximately 130 sightings for the other models. Thinning the sighting data for the taxon with narrower habitats seemed to be less detrimental to model predictive performance than for the broader habitat taxon. To generate reliable habitat modelling predictions for rarely sighted marine predators, our results suggest (1) using GAMs with a Tweedie distribution with presence-absence data and (2) implementing, as a conservative empirical measure, at least 50 sightings in the models.},

	abstract = {Oligotrophic regions are expected to host low densities of top predators. Nevertheless, top predators with contrasting energetic costs might respond differently to the productivity of their habitats. Predators with high energetic demands might be constrained to select the most productive habitats to meet their high energetic requirements, whereas less active predators would be able to satisfy their needs by exploiting either high or low productivity habitats. Although situated in the core of the South Paciﬁc oligotrophic gyre, French Polynesia is characterized by a fairly marked productivity gradient from the extremely oligotrophic Australs area to the more productive Marquesas area. The aim of this study was to investigate cetacean and seabird habitats in French Polynesia in light of their general energetic constraints. We collected cetacean and seabird sightings from an aerial survey across French Polynesian waters during the austral summer 2011. We classiﬁed cetaceans and seabirds into energetic guilds according to the literature. For each guild, we built generalized additive models along with static covariates and oceanographic covariates at the seasonal and climatological resolutions. We provided regional habitat predictions for Delphininae, Globicephalinae, sperm and beaked whales, tropicbirds, grey terns, noddies, white terns, boobies, petrels and shearwaters, sooty terns and frigatebirds. Explained deviances ranged from 5\% to 30\% for cetaceans and from 14\% to 29\% for seabirds. Cetaceans clearly responded to the productivity gradient, with the highest predicted densities around the productive waters of the Marquesas. However, Delphininae and Globicephalinae, characterized by higher energetic demands, depended more strongly on productivity, showing a ratio of 1–26 and 1–31 between their lowest and highest density areas respectively, compared to the less active sperm and beaked whales (showing only a ratio of 1–3.5 in predicted densities). In contrast, seabird distributions appeared more governed by the availability of nesting and roosting sites than by energetic constraints.},

	abstract = {Marine ecosystems are characterised by strong heterogeneity and variability, both spatially and temporally. In particular, seasonal variations may lead to severe constraints for predators which have to cope with these variations, for example through migration to avoid unfavourable seasons, or adaptation to local modiﬁcation of the ecosystem. In the Bay of Biscay and English Channel, ecosystem seasonality is well marked, especially over the shelf. Cetacean and seabird communities within the Bay of Biscay, Celtic Sea and English Channel were studied during aerial surveys conducted in winter 2011–2012 and summer 2012, following a strip-transect methodology deployed from the coast to oceanic waters. We explored seasonal variations of habitat preferences of four cetacean and six seabird groups through Generalised Additive Models, using physiographic variables and weekly- and monthly-averaged oceanographic predictors for both seasons. Our results provided the ﬁrst overview at such a large scale of the variation of habitat preferences in response to the seasonality of the ocean by seabirds in that region, at such a large scale. Habitat models resulted in explained deviances from 13 to 55\%. Predators answered the seasonality of their environment in different ways. Long-ﬁnned pilot whales and Risso's dolphins were the only studied group exhibiting no habitat variations between seasons, targeting the shelf break throughout the year. The other groups modulated their habitat preferences between seasons to optimise the compromise between the ocean seasonal variations and their own constraints: common and striped dolphins, bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises for cetaceans; northern gannets, auks, northern fulmars and kittiwakes for seabirds. For shearwaters, the seasonality had an extreme impact, inducing a complete absence from the region during the unfavourable season.},

	abstract = {As human activities expand beyond national jurisdictions to the high seas, there is an increasing need to consider anthropogenic impacts to species inhabiting these waters. The current scarcity of scientific observations of cetaceans in the high seas impedes the assessment of population-level impacts of these activities. We developed plausible density estimates to facilitate a quantitative assessment of anthropogenic impacts on cetacean populations in these waters. Our study region extended from a well-surveyed region within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone into a large region of the western North Atlantic sparsely surveyed for cetaceans. We modeled densities of 15 cetacean taxa with available line transect survey data and habitat covariates and extrapolated predictions to sparsely surveyed regions. We formulated models to reduce the extent of extrapolation beyond covariate ranges, and constrained them to model simple and generalizable relationships. To evaluate confidence in the predictions, we mapped where predictions were made outside sampled covariate ranges, examined alternate models, and compared predicted densities with maps of sightings from sources that could not be integrated into our models. Confidence levels in model results depended on the taxon and geographic area and highlighted the need for additional surveying in environmentally distinct areas. With application of necessary caution, our density estimates can inform management needs in the high seas, such as the quantification of potential cetacean interactions with military training exercises, shipping, fisheries, and deep-sea mining and be used to delineate areas of special biological significance in international waters. Our approach is generally applicable to other marine taxa and geographic regions for which management will be implemented but data are sparse.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in technologies have lead to a vast inﬂux of data on movements, based on discrete recorded position of animals or ﬁshing boats, opening new horizons for future analyses. However, most of the potential interest of tracking data depends on the ability to develop suitable modelling strategies to analyze trajectories from discrete recorded positions. A serious modelling challenge is to infer the evolution of the true position and the associated spatio-temporal distribution of behavioural states using discrete, error-prone and incomplete observations. In this paper, a Bayesian Hierarchical Model (HBM) using Hidden Markov Process (HMP) is proposed as a template for analyzing ﬁshing boats trajectories based on data available from satellite-based vessel monitoring systems (VMS). The analysis seeks to enhance the deﬁnition of the ﬁshing pressure exerted on ﬁsh stocks, by discriminating between the different behavioural states of a ﬁshing trip, and also by quantifying the relative importance of each of these states during a ﬁshing trip. The HBM approach is tested to analyse the behaviour of pelagic trawlers in the Bay of Biscay. A hidden Markov chain with a regular discrete time step is used to model transitions between successive behavioural states (e.g., ﬁshing, steaming, stopping (at Port or at sea)) of each vessel. The parameters of the movement process (speed and turning angles) are deﬁned conditionally upon the behavioural states. Bayesian methods are used to integrate the available data (typically VMS position recorded at discrete time) and to draw inferences on any unknown parameters of the model. The model is ﬁrst tested on simulated data with different parameters structures. Results provide insights on the potential of HBM with HMP to analyze VMS data. They show that if VMS positions are recorded synchronously with the instants at which the process switch from one behavioural state to another, the estimation method provides unbiased and precise inferences on behavioural states and on associated movement parameters. However, if the observations are not gathered with a sufﬁciently high frequency, the performance of the estimation method could be drastically impacted when the discrete observations are not synchronous with the switching instants. The model is then applied to real pathways to estimate variables of interest such as the number of operations per trip, time and distance spent ﬁshing or travelling.},

Despite a long history of using predictive models to understand the dynamics of ecological systems and human disturbance, conservationists do not systematically apply predictive approaches when designing and implementing behavioural interventions. This is an important omission because human behaviour is the underlying cause of current widespread biodiversity loss. Here, we critically assess how predictive approaches can transform the way conservation scientists and practitioners plan for and implement social and behavioural change among people living with wildlife. Our manifesto for predictive conservation recognises that social-ecological systems are dynamic, uncertain and complex, and calls on conservationists to embrace the forward-thinking approach which eﬀective conservation requires.},

Trend estimation is difﬁcult because of small sample size and relatively large uncertainty in abundance/density estimates of many wild populations of animals. Focusing on cetaceans, we performed a prospective analysis to estimate power, type-I, sign (type-S) and magnitude (type-M) error rates of detecting a decline in short time-series of abundance estimates with different signal-to-noise ratio. We contrasted results from both unregularized (classical) and regularized approaches. The latter allows to incorporate prior information when estimating a trend. Power to detect a statistically signiﬁcant estimates was in general lower than 80\%, except for large declines. The unregularized approach (status quo) had inﬂated type-I error rates and gave biased (either over- or under-) estimates of a trend. The regularized approach with a weakly-informative prior offered the best trade-off in terms of bias, statistical power, type-I, type-S and type-M error rates and conﬁdence interval coverage. To facilitate timely conservation decisions, we recommend to use the regularized approach with a weakly-informative prior in the detection and estimation of trend with short and noisy time-series of abundance estimates.},

	abstract = {Bayesian inference is an important statistical tool that is increasingly being used by ecologists. In a Bayesian analysis, information available before a study is conducted is summarized in a quantitative model or hypothesis: the prior probability distribution. BayesÕ Theorem uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution. Posterior probability distributions are an epistemological alternative to P-values and provide a direct measure of the degree of belief that can be placed on models, hypotheses, or parameter estimates. Moreover, Bayesian information-theoretic methods provide robust measures of the probability of alternative models, and multiple models can be averaged into a single model that reflects uncertainty in model construction and selection. These methods are demonstrated through a simple worked example. Ecologists are using Bayesian inference in studies that range from predicting single-species population dynamics to understanding ecosystem processes. Not all ecologists, however, appreciate the philosophical underpinnings of Bayesian inference. In particular, Bayesians and frequentists differ in their definition of probability and in their treatment of model parameters as random variables or estimates of true values. These assumptions must be addressed explicitly before deciding whether or not to use Bayesian methods to analyse ecological data.},

	abstract = {Climate envelope models (CEMs) have been used to predict the distribution of species under current, past, and future climatic conditions by inferring a species’ environmental requirements from localities where it is currently known to occur. CEMs can be evaluated for their ability to predict current species distributions but it is unclear whether models that are successful in predicting current distributions are equally successful in predicting distributions under different climates (i.e. different regions or time periods). We evaluated the ability of CEMs to predict species distributions under different climates by comparing their predictions with those obtained with a mechanistic model (MM). In an MM the distribution of a species is modeled based on knowledge of a species’ physiology. The potential distributions of 100 plant species were modeled with an MM for current conditions, a past climate reconstruction (21 000 years before present) and a future climate projection (double preindustrial CO2 conditions). Point localities extracted from the currently suitable area according to the MM were used to predict current, future, and past distributions with four CEMs covering a broad range of statistical approaches: Bioclim (percentile distributions), Domain (distance metric), GAM (general additive modeling), and Maxent (maximum entropy). Domain performed very poorly, strongly underestimating range sizes for past or future conditions. Maxent and GAM performed as well under current climates as under past and future climates. Bioclim slightly underestimated range sizes but the predicted ranges overlapped more with the ranges predicted with the MM than those predicted with GAM did. Ranges predicted with Maxent overlapped most with those produced with the MMs, but compared with the ranges predicted with GAM they were more variable and sometimes much too large. Our results suggest that some CEMs can indeed be used to predict species distributions under climate change, but individual modeling approaches should be validated for this purpose, and model choice could be made dependent on the purpose of a particular study.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to compare three social cognitive models in their ability to explain intentions of precautionary online behaviour. The models are: protection motivation theory (PMT), the reasoned action approach (RAA) and an integrated model comprising variables of these models.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Data were collected from 1,200 Dutch users of online banking by means of an online survey and analysed using partial least squares path modelling method.
            
            
              Findings
              The two models equally explain about much of the variance in precautionary online behaviour; in the integrated model, the significant predictors of the two models remained significant. Precautionary online behaviour is largely driven by response efficacy, attitude towards behaviour and self-efficacy.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              One limitation is that the predictor variables – “self-efficacy” and “attitude” – are represented by one item only in the path-analysis because of high cross-loadings of the other items with the dependent variable.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The results give practitioners a potentially wider range of options to design preventative measures.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The three models are successfully applied to online banking. This paper concludes that both PMT and RAA make a unique contribution in explaining variance for precautionary online behaviour. This paper is a re-publication of a previous conference paper (Jansen and van Schaik, 2016).},

As an example, we apply this method to oviposition preference data for butterflies in the genus Lycaeides. Using this method, we estimate the parameters that describe preference for each population, compare the preference hierarchies among populations, and explore various models that group populations that share the same preference hierarchy.},

Assuming perfect detection introduces bias into estimation that can weaken inference upon which understanding and policy are based.

We conducted a quantitative literature review of 537 ecological articles to measure the degree to which studies of different taxa, at various scales, and over time have accounted for imperfect detection. Overall, just 23\% of articles accounted for imperfect detection. The probability that an article incorporated imperfect detection increased with time and varied among taxa studied; studies of vertebrates were more likely to incorporate imperfect detection. Among articles that reported detection probability, 70\% contained per-survey estimates of detection that were less than 0.5. For articles in which constancy of detection was tested, 86\% reported significant variation. We hope that our findings prompt more ecologists to consider carefully the detection process when designing studies and analyzing results, especially for subdisciplines where incorporation of imperfect detection in study design and analysis so far has been lacking.},

In all, 17 873 nautical miles were surveyed, and 1008 encounters of 13 identiﬁed species, including delphinids, ziphiids, harbour porpoise, and sperm whale, were recorded. The common dolphin was the commonest species, followed in decreasing occurrence by striped and bottlenose dolphins, pilot whale, harbour porpoise, Cuvier’s beaked whale, and sperm whales. The distribution of harbour porpoises was restricted to the shallow waters of the western English Channel. Common and bottlenose dolphins were distributed mainly over the continental shelf, although there were some encounters along the shelf edge and in the open ocean. Striped dolphins and pilot whales were sighted in oceanic waters in the central and southern Bay of Biscay. Cuvier’s beaked whales and sperm whales were recorded in the deep oceanic waters of the southern Bay of Biscay.

In this study, a seasonal comparison of the abundance and distribution of cetaceans was carried out in two contrasted regions of the Eastern North Atlantic, the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel. Estimates were obtained in the two sub-regions (375,000 km²) from large aerial surveys conducted in the winter (November 2011 to February 2012) and in the summer (May to August 2012). The most abundant species encountered in the Channel, the harbour porpoise, displayed strong seasonal variations in its distribution but a stable abundance (18,000 individuals, CV=30\%). In the Bay of Biscay, abundance and distribution patterns of common / striped dolphins varied from 285,000 individuals (95\% CI: 174,000–481,000) in the winter, preferentially distributed close to the shelf break, to 494,000 individuals (95\% CI: 342,000−719,000) distributed beyond the shelf break in summer. Baleen whales also exhibited an increase of their density in summer. Seasonal abundances of bottlenose dolphins were quite stable, with a large number of ‘pelagic’ encounters oﬀshore in winter. No signiﬁcant seasonal diﬀerence was estimated for pilot whales and sperm whale. These surveys provided baseline estimates to inform policies to be developed, or for existing conservation instruments such as the Habitats Directive. In addition, our results supported the hypothesis of a shift in the summer distributions of some species such as harbour porpoise and minke whale in European waters.},

The current scarcity of scientific observations of cetaceans in the high seas impedes the assessment of population-level impacts of these activities. We developed plausible density estimates to facilitate a quantitative assessment of anthropogenic impacts on cetacean populations in these waters. Our study region extended from a well-surveyed region within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone into a large region of the western North Atlantic sparsely surveyed for cetaceans. We modeled densities of 15 cetacean taxa with available line transect survey data and habitat covariates and extrapolated predictions to sparsely surveyed regions. We formulated models to reduce the extent of extrapolation beyond covariate ranges, and constrained them to model simple and generalizable relationships. To evaluate confidence in the predictions, we mapped where predictions were made outside sampled covariate ranges, examined alternate models, and compared predicted densities with maps of sightings from sources that could not be integrated into our models. Confidence levels in model results depended on the taxon and geographic area and highlighted the need for additional surveying in environmentally distinct areas. With application of necessary caution, our density estimates can inform management needs in the high seas, such as the quantification of potential cetacean interactions with military training exercises, shipping, fisheries, and deep-sea mining and be used to delineate areas of special biological significance in international waters. Our approach is generally applicable to other marine taxa and geographic regions for which management will be implemented but data are sparse.},

However, in the past few decades ecologists have become increasingly interested in the use of Bayesian methods of data analysis. In this article I provide guidance to ecologists who would like to decide whether Bayesian methods can be used to improve their conclusions and predictions. I begin by providing a concise summary of Bayesian methods of analysis, including a comparison of differences between Bayesian and frequentist approaches to inference when using hierarchical models. Next I provide a list of problems where Bayesian methods of analysis may arguably be preferred over frequentist methods. These problems are usually encountered in analyses based on hierarchical models of data. I describe the essentials required for applying modern methods of Bayesian computation, and I use real-world examples to illustrate these methods. I conclude by summarizing what I perceive to be the main strengths and weaknesses of using Bayesian methods to solve ecological inference problems.},

	abstract = {Indonesia harbours a high diversity of cetaceans, yet effective conservation is hampered by a lack of knowledge about cetacean spatial distribution and habitat preferences. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap at an adequate resolution to support national cetacean conservation and management planning. Maximum Entropy (Maxent) modelling was used to map the distribution of 15 selected cetacean species in seven areas within Indonesian waters using recent cetacean presence datasets as well as environmental predictors (topographic and oceanographic variables). We then combined the individual species suitable habitat maps and overlaid them with provincial marine spatial planning (MSP) jurisdictions, marine protected areas (MPAs), oil and gas contract areas, and marine traffic density. Our results reflect a great heterogeneity in distribution among species and within species among different locations. This heterogeneity reflects an interrelated influence of topographic variables and oceanographic processes on the distribution of cetacean species. Bathymetry, distance to- coast and the − 200m isobaths, and chlorophyll-a concentration and sea surface temperature were important variables influencing distribution of most species in many regions. Areas rich in species were mainly related to coastal areas or insular-reef complexity, representing high productivity and upwelling-modified waters. Although some important suitable habitats currently fall within MPAs, other areas are not and overlap with oil and gas explo­ ration activities and marine traffic, indicating potentially high risk areas for cetaceans. The results of this study can support national cetacean conservation and management planning, and be used to reduce or avoid adverse anthropogenic threats. We advise to consider currently unprotected suitable cetacean habitats in MPA and MSP development.},

We found that only {\textasciitilde}12.1\% of studies compare distributional shifts across multiple directions, {\textasciitilde}1.6\% distinguish observed patterns from random expectations, and {\textasciitilde}19.66\% examine multicausal factors. Last, {\textasciitilde}75.5\% of studies report sufficient data and results to allow replication. We show that despite gradual improvements over time, there is scope for raising standards in data and methods within reports of climate-change induced shifts in species distribution.

	abstract = {Empirically derived species distributions models (SDMs) are increasingly relied upon to forecast species vulnerabilities to future climate change. However, many of the assumptions of SDMs may be violated when they are used to project species distributions across signiﬁcant climate change events. In particular, SDM’s in theory assume stable fundamental niches, but in practice, they assume stable realized niches. The assumption of a ﬁxed realized niche relative to climate variables remains unlikely for various reasons, particularly if novel future climates open up currently unavailable portions of species’ fundamental niches. To demonstrate this effect, we compare the climate distributions for fossil-pollen data from 21 to 15 ka BP (relying on paleoclimate simulations) when communities and climates with no modern analog were common across North America to observed modern pollen assemblages. We test how well SDMs are able to project 20th century pollen-based taxon distributions with models calibrated using data from 21 to 15 ka. We ﬁnd that taxa which were abundant in areas with no-analog late glacial climates, such as Fraxinus, Ostrya/ Carpinus and Ulmus, substantially shifted their realized niches from the late glacial period to present. SDMs for these taxa had low predictive accuracy when projected to modern climates despite demonstrating high predictive accuracy for late glacial pollen distributions. For other taxa, e.g. Quercus, Picea, Pinus strobus, had relatively stable realized niches and models for these taxa tended to have higher predictive accuracy when projected to present. Our ﬁndings reinforce the point that a realized niche at any one time often represents only a subset of the climate conditions in which a taxon can persist. Projections from SDMs into future climate conditions that are based solely on contemporary realized distributions are potentially misleading for assessing the vulnerability of species to future climate change.},

	abstract = {In recent years, complex large-scale watershed models have been developed to perform simulations of hydrologic and nutrient processes. The potential impact caused by human activities such as agricultural implementations against the environment can be evaluated under future scenarios. Meanwhile, large amount of input data are required to enhance the performance of simulated results. For some natural or urban regions, it is possible to have multiple sources of geophysical data available but the associated effects of using alternating data sources on modeling results is not yet evaluated. In this study, three sources of land use data (Mid-Atlantic Regional Earth Science Applications Center (RESAC 2000), National Land Use Cover Dataset (NLCD 2001), and State Land Use/Cover Maps (STATE) were implemented on the Greensboro watershed, Maryland, USA. The Alternative Dataset Scheme (ADS) and the Parameter Transferability Scheme (PTS) were applied to investigate model predictive uncertainty and the potential impact of cross transferring optimal calibration parameters between models. It was demonstrated that model predictions simulated by SWAT model had better performance when RESAC land use map was used, followed by STATE, and NLCD land use maps. In addition, calibrated best parameter set from RESAC has presented relatively more transferable compared to NLCD and STATE. The use of varying data source may not only alter model predictions and the associated predictive uncertainty but also have direct impact on the transferability of model parameters. The major ﬁndings in this study may help future modelers and decision makers to recognize the importance of alternative data source selection. Therefore, the quality of subsequent research work, engineering applications or policies can be further improved.},

	abstract = {Climate change is one of the most serious global environmental problems and it is of great importance to understand how species respond to climate change. Species distribution models (SDMs) have been regarded as an eﬀective tool to examine the impacts of climate change on species’ potential distribution. In this study, we developed a SDM for a marine ﬁsh, the Japanese whiting Sillago japonica by using records of its occurrence and ﬁve predictor variables (ocean depth, distance to shore, mean sea surface temperature, salinity, and currents velocity) and predicted its habitat suitability for current conditions and under scenarios of future climates. The SDM suggests that ocean depth, distance to shore, and temperature are the three most important predictor variables determining the distribution of S. japonica. Our SDM accurately predicted the current distribution of the species, with values of true skill statistics and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve above 0.95. Under future climate scenarios, the suitable habitat of S. japonica is predicted to become smaller in size and to shift northward. Diﬀerences between climate change scenarios for 2040–2050 and 2090–2100 showed that this species will lose more suitable habitat as climate change progresses over time. Future ﬁsheries management strategies should take this range contraction and associated northward shift into account.},

	abstract = {Recognizing the importance of precise determination of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is a principal step in the attempts to reserve huge quantities of squandered water. This paper investigates the efﬁciency of Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) algorithm at predicting Penman–Monteith (P–M) ET0 for Mosul, Baghdad, and Basrah meteorological stations, located at the north, mid, and southern part of Iraq. Data of weather parameters containing maximum air temperature (Tmax), minimum air temperature (Tmin), sunshine hours (Rn), relative humidity (Rh), and wind speed (U2) for the period (2000–2013) are used as inputs to the ELM model by using four different input cases including complete and incomplete sets of meteorological data. The performance of ELM model is compared with the empirical P–M equation and with feedforward backpropagation (FFBP) model. The evaluation criteria used for comparison are the root of mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefﬁcient of determination (R2). The statistical results of both models are found to be encouraging; particularly results of running the ELM model with incomplete sets of data, noticing that the sensitivity of the proposed model to missing data changes from one location to another, as well as along the year for certain study location. The Rn is found to be the most effective parameter in Mosul Station, while U2 and Rh are found to act almost in parallel with Rn in Baghdad Station, and for conditions of Basrah Station; U2 and Rh prove to be the dominant parameters. The minimum and maximum time intervals required for running ELM model for all stations, and in all applied conditions, are (4.64–6.19) seconds respectively, while the same order of timing required for running the FFBP model is (6.30–27.80) seconds. The maximum R2 recorded for the ELM model is 0.991, while for the FFBP it is 0.985. The ELM proved to be efﬁcient, simple in application, of high speed, and has very good generalization performance; therefore, this algorithm is highly recommended for locations similar to the geographical and meteorological conditions of Iraq that consists of both arid and semiarid regions.},

	abstract = {Species Distribution Models (SDMs) constitute an important tool to assist decision-making in environmental conservation and planning. A popular application of these models is the projection of species distributions under climate change conditions. Yet there are still a range of methodological SDM factors which limit the transferability of these models, contributing signiﬁcantly to the overall uncertainty of the resulting projections. An important source of uncertainty often neglected in climate change studies comes from the use of background data (a.k.a. pseudo-absences) for model calibration. Here, we study the sensitivity to pseudo-absence sampling as a determinant factor for SDM stability and transferability under climate change conditions, focusing on European wide projections of Quercus robur as an illustrative case study. We explore the uncertainty in future projections derived from ten pseudo-absence realizations and three popular SDMs (GLM, Random Forest and MARS). The contribution of the pseudo-absence realization to the uncertainty was higher in peripheral regions and clearly diﬀered among the tested SDMs in the whole study domain, being MARS the most sensitive — with projections diﬀering up to a 40\% for diﬀerent realizations — and GLM the most stable. As a result we conclude that parsimonious SDMs are preferable in this context, avoiding complex methods (such as MARS) which may exhibit poor model transferability. Accounting for this new source of SDM-dependent uncertainty is crucial when forming multi-model ensembles to undertake climate change projections.},

This paper highlights speciﬁc modelling challenges to consider when exploring coupled socio-environmental systems experiencing regime shifts. We explore these challenges in the context of four modelling approaches that have been applied to the study of regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems: statistical, system dynamics, equilibrium and agent-based modelling. When reviewing these modelling approaches we reﬂect on a set of criteria including the ability of an approach (1) to capture feedbacks between social and environmental system, (2) to represent the sources of regime shifts, (3) to incorporate complexity aspects, and (4) to deal with regime shift identiﬁcation. Many of the modelling examples considered do not provide information on all these criteria, which receive a lot of attention in empirical studies of registered regime shifts. This suggests a need to develop a common modelling terminology in the domain of modelling for resilience and regime shifts. When discussing strengths and weaknesses of various modelling paradigms we conclude that a hybrid approach is likely to provide most insights into the processes and consequences of regime shifts. Challenges and frontier directions of research for designing models to study regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems are outlined.},

Empirical support for this approach relies on our ability to use observations of a species’ distribution in one region to predict its range in other regions (model transferability). On the basis of this observation, ecologists have hypothesized that climate is the strongest determinant of species’ distributions at large spatial scales. However, it is difﬁcult to reconcile this claim with the pervasive effects of biotic interactions. Here, we resolve this apparent paradox by demonstrating how biotic interactions can affect species’ range margins yet still be compatible with model transferability. We also identify situations where small changes in species’ interactions dramatically shift range margins.},

	abstract = {Ecological risk assessment (ERA) is the process used to evaluate the safety of manufactured chemicals to the environment. Here we review the pros and cons of ERA across levels of biological organization, including suborganismal (e.g., biomarkers), individual, population, community, ecosystem and landscapes levels. Our review revealed that level of biological organization is often related negatively with ease at assessing cause–effect relationships, ease of high-throughput screening of large numbers of chemicals (it is especially easier for suborganismal endpoints), and uncertainty of the ERA because low levels of biological organization tend to have a large distance between their measurement (what is quantified) and assessment endpoints (what is to be protected). In contrast, level of biological organization is often related positively with sensitivity to important negative and positive feedbacks and context dependencies within biological systems, and ease at capturing recovery from adverse contaminant effects. Some endpoints did not show obvious trends across levels of biological organization, such as the use of vertebrate animals in chemical testing and ease at screening large numbers of species, and other factors lacked sufficient data across levels of biological organization, such as repeatability, variability, cost per study and cost per species of effects assessment, the latter of which might be a more defensible way to compare costs of ERAs than cost per study. To compensate for weaknesses of ERA at any particular level of biological organization, we also review mathematical modeling approaches commonly used to extrapolate effects across levels of organization. Finally, we provide recommendations for next generation ERA, submitting that if there is an ideal level of biological organization to conduct ERA, it will only emerge if ERA is approached simultaneously from the bottom of biological organization up as well as from the top down, all while employing mathematical modeling approaches where possible to enhance ERA. Because top-down ERA is unconventional, we also offer some suggestions for how it might be implemented efficaciously. We hope this review helps researchers in the field of ERA fill key information gaps and helps risk assessors identify the best levels of biological organization to conduct ERAs with differing goals.},

The future of landscape ecology depends on whether the two approaches can be integrated. We present an approach to bridge the gap between the many detailed process studies on species, and applied activities such as landscape evaluation and design, which require integrated knowledge. The approach consists of four components: 1) Empirical case studies of different scales, organisms and processes. 2) Modeling studies to extrapolate empirical studies across space and time. 3) Modeling studies to produce guidelines and standards for landscape conditions. 4) Methods and tools for integration to the landscape level, which can be built into multidisciplinary tools for design and evaluation. We conclude that in the landscape ecological literature, the steps 1 and 2 are well represented, whereas the steps 3 and 4 are mostly neglected. We challenge landscape ecologists to push landscape ecology to a higher level of maturation and to further develop its proﬁle as a problem-oriented science.},

We argue that implementation of agreed-upon standards for models in biodiversity assessments would promote transparency and repeatability, eventually leading to higher quality of the models and the inferences used in assessments. We encourage broad community participation toward the expansion and ongoing development of the proposed standards and guidelines.},

	abstract = {Background Ecosystem modeling applied to fisheries remains hampered by a lack of local information. Fishers’ knowledge could fill this gap, improving participation in and the management of fisheries.
Methodology The same fishing area was modeled using two approaches: based on fishers’ knowledge and based on scientific information. For the former, the data was collected by interviews through the Delphi methodology, and for the latter, the data was gathered from the literature. Agreement between the attributes generated by the fishers’ knowledge model and scientific model is discussed and explored, aiming to improve data availability, the ecosystem model, and fisheries management. Principal Findings The ecosystem attributes produced from the fishers’ knowledge model were consistent with the ecosystem attributes produced by the scientific model, and elaborated using only the scientific data from literature.
Conclusions/Significance This study provides evidence that fishers’ knowledge may suitably complement scientific data, and may improve the modeling tools for the research and management of fisheries.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The forest, savanna, and grassland biomes, and the transitions between them, are expected to undergo major changes in the future due to global climate change. Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are very useful for understanding vegetation dynamics under the present climate, and for predicting its changes under future conditions. However, several DGVMs display high uncertainty in predicting vegetation in tropical areas. Here we perform a comparative analysis of three different DGVMs (JSBACH, LPJ-GUESS-SPITFIRE and aDGVM) with regard to their representation of the ecological mechanisms and feedbacks that determine the forest, savanna, and grassland biomes, in an attempt to bridge the knowledge gap between ecology and global modeling. The outcomes of the models, which include different mechanisms, are compared to observed tree cover along a mean annual precipitation gradient in Africa. By drawing on the large number of recent studies that have delivered new insights into the ecology of tropical ecosystems in general, and of savannas in particular, we identify two main mechanisms that need improved representation in the examined DGVMs. The first mechanism includes water limitation to tree growth, and tree–grass competition for water, which are key factors in determining savanna presence in arid and semi-arid areas. The second is a grass–fire feedback, which maintains both forest and savanna presence in mesic areas. Grasses constitute the majority of the fuel load, and at the same time benefit from the openness of the landscape after fires, since they recover faster than trees. Additionally, these two mechanisms are better represented when the models also include tree life stages (adults and seedlings), and distinguish between fire-prone and shade-tolerant forest trees, and fire-resistant and shade-intolerant savanna trees. Including these basic elements could improve the predictive ability of the DGVMs, not only under current climate conditions but also and especially under future scenarios.},

Within this framework, the present study focuses on the distribution of cetaceans in this area and is part of the Spanish Ministry of the Environment’s ‘‘Program for the Identiﬁcation of Areas of Special Interest for the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Spanish Mediterranean’’. Shipboard visual surveys were conducted in 1992 and from 1995 to 2001 in the north-eastern Alboran Sea, covering 14,409 km. A total of 1,134 sightings of cetaceans were made. From the data collected, the distribution of seven species of odontocete was examined with respect to two physiographic variables, water depth and slope. Analyses of w2 and ﬁtting of GLMs demonstrated signiﬁcant differences in distribution for all species, mainly with respect to depth. Kruskal–Wallis tests, factor analysis and discriminant function analysis showed that the species could be classiﬁed in two major groups, shallow-waters (short-beaked common dolphin and bottlenose dolphin) and deep-waters (striped dolphin, Risso’s dolphin, long-ﬁnned pilot whale, sperm whale and beaked whale), respectively. Preferred habitats in terms of water depth were areas deeper than 600 m for the deep-water group, and the shallower ranges from shore to 400 m for the other. The distribution of cetaceans was further matched with that of their most common prey in order to establish which habitats could be considered important for their feeding. The resulting analysis highlighted two areas in the region as important habitats for the conservation of the most vulnerable species in the Mediterranean, the bottlenose and the common dolphin.},

	abstract = {Shelf-seas are highly dynamic and oceanographically complex environments, which likely inﬂuences the spatio-temporal distributions of marine megafauna such as marine mammals. As such, understanding natural patterns in habitat use by these animals is essential when attempting to ascertain and assess the impacts of anthropogenically induced disturbances, such as those associated with marine renewable energy installations (MREIs). This study uses a ﬁve year (2009–2013) passive acoustics (C-POD) dataset to examine the use of an oceanographically dynamic marine renewable energy test site by small cetaceans, dolphins (unspeciﬁed delphinids) and harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena, in the southern Celtic Sea. To examine how temporal patterns in habitat use across the site related to oceanographic changes occurring over broad seasonal scales as well as those driven by ﬁne scale (bi-weekly) localised processes (that may be masked by seasonal trends), separate analyses were conducted using (1) all daily animal detection rates spanning the entire ﬁve year dataset and (2) daily animal detection rates taken only during the summer months (deﬁned as mid-June to mid-October) of 2010 (when continuous monitoring was carried out at multiple discrete locations across the site). In both instances, generalised additive mixed effects models (GAMMs) were used to link detection rates to a suite of environmental variables representative of the oceanography of the region. We show that increased harbour porpoise detection rates in the late winter/early spring (January–March) are associated with low sea surface temperatures (SST), whilst peaks in dolphin detection rates in the summer (July–September) coincide with increased SSTs and the presence of a tidal-mixing front. Moreover, across the summer months of 2010, dolphin detection rates were found to respond to small scale changes in SST and position in the spring-neap cycle, possibly reﬂective of a preference for the stratiﬁed waters immediately offshore of the front. Together, these ﬁndings suggest that habitat use by small cetaceans within shelf-seas is temporally variable, species speciﬁc and likely driven by complex bottom-up processes. As such, the effective conservation management of shelf-seas requires that we understand the dynamic complexities of these systems and the species that inhabit them. In particular, we emphasise the need for a good understanding of the natural drivers of habitat use by marine megafauna before the potential impacts of anthropogenically induced disturbances, such as those associated with the construction, maintenance and operation of MREIs, can be assessed.},

Next I provide a list of problems where Bayesian methods of analysis may arguably be preferred over frequentist methods. These problems are usually encountered in analyses based on hierarchical models of data. I describe the essentials required for applying modern methods of Bayesian computation, and I use real-world examples to illustrate these methods.

We explored different evaluation metrics based on independent testing data using the Darwin’s Fox (Lycalopex fulvipes) as a detailed case in point. Six ecological niche models (ENMs; generalized linear models, boosted regression trees, Maxent, GARP, multivariable kernel density estimation, and NicheA) were explored and tested using six evaluation metrics (partial ROC, Akaike information criterion, omission rate, cumulative binomial probability), including two novel metrics to quantify model extrapolation versus interpolation (E-­space index I) and extent of extrapolation versus Jaccard similarity (E-­space index II). Different ENMs showed diverse and mixed performance, depending on the evaluation metric used. Because ENMs performed differently according to the evaluation metric employed, model selection should be based on the data available, assumptions necessary, and the particular research question. The typical ROC AUC evaluation approach should be discontinued when only presence data are available, and evaluations in environmental dimensions should be adopted as part of the toolkit of ENM researchers. Our results suggest that selecting Maxent ENM based solely on previous reports of its performance is a questionable practice. Instead, model comparisons, including diverse algorithms and parameterizations, should be the sine qua non for every study using ecological niche modeling. ENM evaluations should be developed using metrics that assess desired model characteristics instead of single measurement of fit between model and data. The metrics proposed herein that assess model performance in environmental space (i.e., E-­space indices I and II) may complement current methods for ENM evaluation.},

	abstract = {The construction of predictive models of species distribution for conservation and regional planning can be facilitated by automatic procedures employed for the selection and transformation of predictors. It has been claimed, however, that empirical predictive models benefit from the inclusion of expert opinion at different stages of the model-building process. This is a time-consuming task that is limited by the availability of experts and difficult to standardize. Automated procedures for predictor selection based on statistical criteria are faster and easier to integrate into a geographic information system and may render highly explanatory models that fit the data with which they were built. But these models do not necessarily predict independent observations well and cannot be used to extrapolate to other areas. On the contrary, supervised models may include more frequently causal relationships, and therefore may more accurately predict new observations and extrapolate better to other areas. We built predictive models for the presence/absence of 10 bird species in two areas of Andalusia (southwestern Spain) to compare three different procedures for predictor selection ranging from a completely unsupervised to a fully supervised method. We evaluated models in three ways: (1) with the same data used to build the models, (2) with a different evaluation data set, and (3) with data from a different geographic area. The increase in the degree of expert input during model construction resulted in a significant decrease of model predictive ability when evaluated with an independent data set, and did not improve the predictive ability of the model when transferred to a new area. Unsupervised models had a greater tendency to overfit the building data, but this did not negatively affect model predictive ability or transferability to a new area. Incorporating expert opinion in the model-building process neither rendered better models as measured by their predictive ability nor resulted in models that were better suited to other regions. Therefore, unsupervised fitting procedures seem to be an adequate and cost-effective way to proceed when the aim is to generate potential distribution maps of species in a regional context.},

	abstract = {Environmental niche models (ENMs) are increasingly used in many scientific fields, with most studies requiring the application of the ENM to predict the likelihood of occurrence and/or environmental suitability in locations and time periods outside the range of the data set used to fit the model. Uncertainty in the quality of ENM predictions caused by errors of interpolation and extrapolation has been acknowledged for a long time, but the explicit consideration of the magnitude of such errors is, as yet, uncommon. Among other issues, the spatial variation in the colinearity of the environmental predictor variables used in the development of ENMs may cause misleading predictions when applying ENMs to novel locations and time periods. In this paper, we provide a framework for the spatially explicit identification of areas prone to errors caused by changes in the inter-correlation structure (i.e. their colinearity) of environmental predictors used for ENM development. The proposed method is compatible with all ENM algorithms currently employed, and expands the available toolbox for assessing the uncertainties rising from ENM predictions. We provide an implementation of the analysis as a script for the R statistical platform in an online appendix.},

	abstract = {Many previous studies have attempted to assess ecological niche modeling performance using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) approaches, even though diverse problems with this metric have been pointed out in the literature. We explored different evaluation metrics based on independent testing data using the Darwin’s Fox (Lycalopex fulvipes) as a detailed case in point. Six ecological niche models (ENMs; generalized linear models, boosted regression trees, Maxent, GARP, multivariable kernel density estimation, and NicheA) were explored and tested using six evaluation metrics (partial ROC, Akaike information criterion, omission rate, cumulative binomial probability), including two novel metrics to quantify model extrapolation versus interpolation (E-­space index I) and extent of extrapolation versus Jaccard similarity (E-­space index II). Different ENMs showed diverse and mixed performance, depending on the evaluation metric used. Because ENMs performed differently according to the evaluation metric employed, model selection should be based on the data available, assumptions necessary, and the particular research question. The typical ROC AUC evaluation approach should be discontinued when only presence data are available, and evaluations in environmental dimensions should be adopted as part of the toolkit of ENM researchers. Our results suggest that selecting Maxent ENM based solely on previous reports of its performance is a questionable practice. Instead, model comparisons, including diverse algorithms and parameterizations, should be the sine qua non for every study using ecological niche modeling. ENM evaluations should be developed using metrics that assess desired model characteristics instead of single measurement of fit between model and data. The metrics proposed herein that assess model performance in environmental space (i.e., E-­space indices I and II) may complement current methods for ENM evaluation.},

	abstract = {The North Sea is one of the most heavily used shelf regions worldwide with a diversity of human impacts, including shipping, pollution, ﬁsheries, and offshore constructions. These stressors on the environment can have consequences for marine organisms, such as our study species, the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), which is regarded as a sentinel species and hence has a high conservation priority in the European Union (EU). As EU member states are obliged to monitor the population status, the present study aims to estimate trends in absolute harbor porpoise abundance in the German North Sea based on almost two decades of aerial surveys (2002–2019) using line-transect methodology. Furthermore, we were interested in trends in three Natura2000 Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), which include the harbor porpoise as designated feature. Trends were estimated for each SAC and two seasons (spring and summer) as well as the complete area of the German North Sea. For the trend analysis we applied a Bayesian framework to a series of replicated visual surveys, allowing to propagate the error structure of the original abundance estimates to the ﬁnal trend estimate and designed to deal with spatio-temporal heterogeneity and other sources of uncertainty. In general, harbor porpoise abundance decreased in northern areas and increased in the south, such as in the SAC Borkum Reef Ground. A particularly strong decline with a high probability (94.9\%) was detected in the core area and main reproduction site in summer, the SAC Sylt Outer Reef (−3.79\% per year). The overall trend for the German North Sea revealed a decrease in harbor porpoise abundance over the whole study period (−1.79\% per year) with high probability (95.1\%). The assessment of these trends in abundance based on systematic monitoring should now form the basis for adaptive management, especially in the SAC Sylt Outer Reef, where the underlying causes and drivers for the large decline remain unknown and deserve further investigation, also in a regional North Sea wide context.},

	abstract = {Cetacean–habitat modeling, although still in the early stages of development, represents a potentially powerful tool for predicting cetacean distributions and understanding the ecological processes determining these distributions. Marine ecosystems vary temporally on diel to decadal scales and spatially on scales from several meters to 1000s of kilometers. Many cetacean species are wideranging and respond to this variability by changes in distribution patterns. Cetacean–habitat models have already been used to incorporate this variability into management applications, including improvement of abundance estimates, development of marine protected areas, and understanding cetacean–fisheries interactions. We present a review of the development of cetacean–habitat models, organized according to the primary steps involved in the modeling process. Topics covered include purposes for which cetacean–habitat models are developed, scale issues in marine ecosystems, cetacean and habitat data collection, descriptive and statistical modeling techniques, model selection, and model evaluation. To date, descriptive statistical techniques have been used to explore cetacean–habitat relationships for selected species in specific areas; the numbers of species and geographic areas examined using computationally intensive statistic modeling techniques are considerably less, and the development of models to test specific hypotheses about the ecological processes determining cetacean distributions has just begun. Future directions in cetacean–habitat modeling span a wide range of possibilities, from development of basic modeling techniques to addressing important ecological questions.},

	abstract = {When performing habitat models, modellers have to choose between presence-absence and presenceonly models to estimate the habitat preferences of a species. Primarily, this choice depends on the data that are available and whether effort data are recorded in parallel to sighting data. For species that are rare or scarce, the models have to address a great number of zeros (i.e., no animal seen) that weakens the ability to make sound ecological inferences. We tested two types of habitat models (presence-absence vs. presence-only) to determine which type best dealt with datasets containing an excess of zeros, and we applied our models to a sighting dataset that included the common (Delphinus delphis) and striped (Stenella coeruleoalba) dolphin (approximately 92\% zeros). We used two types of presence-absence models (Generalised Additive models – GAMs, Generalised Linear Model – GLM) and one presence-only model, a MaxEnt model, and we used various criteria to compare these models (i.e., AIC, deviances, rootograms and distribution patterns predicted by the models). Overall, we observed that the presence-absence models made better predictions than the presence-only model. Among the presence-absence models, the GAM with a Negative Binomial distribution was better at predicting small delphinids habitats, even though the GAM with a Tweedie distribution exhibited similar results. However, the zero-inﬂated Poisson distributions exhibited less convincing results and was contrary to what was expected. Finally, despite 92\% zeros, our dataset was not zero-inﬂated. Our study demonstrates the importance of selecting appropriate models to make reliable predictions of habitat use for species that are rare or scarce.},

	abstract = {Oceanic fronts shape marine ecosystems; therefore front mapping and characterization are among the most important aspects of physical oceanography. Here we report on the ﬁrst global remote sensing survey of fronts in the Large Marine Ecosystems (LME). This survey is based on a unique frontal data archive assembled at the University of Rhode Island. Thermal fronts were automatically derived with the edge detection algorithm of Cayula and Cornillon (1992, 1995, 1996) from 12 years of twice-daily, global, 9km resolution satellite sea surface temperature (SST) ﬁelds to produce synoptic (nearly instantaneous) frontal maps, and to compute the long-term mean frequency of occurrence of SST fronts and their gradients. These synoptic and long-term maps were used to identify major quasi-stationary fronts and to derive provisional frontal distribution maps for all LMEs. Since SST fronts are typically collocated with fronts in other water properties such as salinity, density and chlorophyll, digital frontal paths from SST frontal maps can be used in studies of physical–biological correlations at fronts. Frontal patterns in several exemplary LMEs are described and compared, including those for: the East and West Bering Sea LMEs, Sea of Okhotsk LME, East China Sea LME, Yellow Sea LME, North Sea LME, East and West Greenland Shelf LMEs, Newfoundland–Labrador Shelf LME, Northeast and Southeast US Continental Shelf LMEs, Gulf of Mexico LME, and Patagonian Shelf LME. Seasonal evolution of frontal patterns in major upwelling zones reveals an order-of-magnitude growth of frontal scales from summer to winter. A classiﬁcation of LMEs with regard to the origin and physics of their respective dominant fronts is presented. The proposed classiﬁcation lends itself to comparative studies of frontal ecosystems.},

In the transition zone one observes a cold salty belt with a front towards the well mixed and a separate front towards the stratified regime. Fronts of the river plume type occur in the eastern part of the bight. Upwelling water in the region of the old Elbe Valley near Helgoland is separated from surrounding water by well developed fronts. Physical observations are discussed together with biological implications as accumulation of organisms and the role of fronts for the distribution of zoo- and phytoplankton communities. It is shown that strong fronts are not necessarily associated with high biomass accumulation.

	abstract = {Studies have shown that pelagic predators do not overlap with their prey at small scales. However, we hypothesized that spinner dolphin foraging would be affected by the spatio-temporal dynamics of their prey at both small and large scales. A modified echosounder was used to simultaneously measure the abundance of dolphins and their prey as a function of space and time off three Hawaiian islands. Spinner dolphin abundance closely matched the abundance patterns in the boundary community both horizontally and vertically. As hypothesized, spinner dolphins followed the diel horizontal migration of their prey, rather than feeding offshore the entire night. Spinner dolphins also followed the vertical migrations of their prey and exploited the vertical areas within the boundary layer that had the highest prey density. Cooperative foraging by pairs of dolphins within large groups was evident. The geometric and density characteristics of prey patches containing dolphins indicate that dolphins may alter the characteristics of prey patches through this cooperative foraging. The overlap of Hawaiian spinner dolphins and their prey at many temporal and spatial scales, ranging from several minutes to an entire night and 20 m to several kilometers, indicates that the availability of truly synoptic data may fundamentally alter our conclusions about pelagic predator-prey interactions.},

	abstract = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classiﬁcation methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reﬂect theoretical ﬁndings on the shape and nature of the species’ response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the ﬁeld of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to deﬁne the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualiﬁcation of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that deﬁne the qualiﬁcation criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Spatial patterns of primary production are in general determined by supply of macronutrients (nitrate, phosphate) from below the thermocline. Where the thermocline is shallow and intersects the lighted euphotic zone, biological production is enhanced. In the eastern tropical Paciﬁc thermocline depth is controlled by three interrelated processes: a basin-scale east/west thermocline tilt, a basin-scale thermocline shoaling at the gyre margins, and local wind-driven upwelling. These processes regulate supply of nutrient-rich subsurface waters to the euphotic zone, and on their basis we have divided the eastern tropical Paciﬁc into seven main regions. Primary production and its physical and chemical controls are described for each.},

We tested the hypothesis that oceanographic features also affect predator distribution by enhancing the proﬁtability of smallsized prey. During July and August 1999, short-tailed shearwaters feeding in Akutan Pass, Alaska (Aleutian Islands) fed upon small (11.6 ± 0.2 mm) euphausiids present in high density near the sea surface. Conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) casts, hydroacoustic surveys, and net tows revealed that high densities of small euphausiids were associated with a tidal front on the north side of Akutan Pass. At most sites elsewhere in the Bering Sea, away from tidal fronts, shearwaters selected larger (14.2–20.1 mm) euphausiids, even when small euphausiids were present. This study provides evidence that, by promoting high densities of easily accessible prey, oceanographic features can broaden the range of prey sizes taken by marine predators.},

	abstract = {Small offshore banks may be sites of intense feeding by upper trophic level predators. We studied the distribution of cetaceans, seabirds, pelagic fish, euphausiids and zooplankton over a 9 × 15 km bank to determine the conditions and processes that concentrated prey there and to examine the relative importance of bottom-up or top-down controls. Euphausiids were the primary prey during most foraging activity. While these were widespread in subsurface waters, foraging was concentrated on dense surface swarms that formed during daylight hours over 2 small crests. Internal wave passage resulted in upward movement and concentration of euphausiids in these areas through a coupling of physical processes and euphausiid behavior, resulting in surface swarms. Thus, internal waves appear to provide a critical mechanism enhancing trophic energy transfer. The formation of dense, localized and accessible prey concentrations was more important to foraging than was the overall available prey biomass. The estimated maximum daily consumption of euphausiids by cetaceans, seabirds and herring combined was {\textless} 0.4\% of the estimated instantaneous euphausiid biomass, and top-down control was unlikely to have substantially influenced euphausiid biomass at this site. Some predator species that do not prey extensively on euphausiids or herring were more prevalent in off-bank waters. The scales of predictability and the temporal dynamics of such features determine the manner in which populations of upper trophic level organisms utilize a variable environment.},

	abstract = {Shelf-seas are highly dynamic and oceanographically complex environments, which likely inﬂuences the spatio-temporal distributions of marine megafauna such as marine mammals. As such, understanding natural patterns in habitat use by these animals is essential when attempting to ascertain and assess the impacts of anthropogenically induced disturbances, such as those associated with marine renewable energy installations (MREIs). This study uses a ﬁve year (2009–2013) passive acoustics (C-POD) dataset to examine the use of an oceanographically dynamic marine renewable energy test site by small cetaceans, dolphins (unspeciﬁed delphinids) and harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena, in the southern Celtic Sea. To examine how temporal patterns in habitat use across the site related to oceanographic changes occurring over broad seasonal scales as well as those driven by ﬁne scale (bi-weekly) localised processes (that may be masked by seasonal trends), separate analyses were conducted using (1) all daily animal detection rates spanning the entire ﬁve year dataset and (2) daily animal detection rates taken only during the summer months (deﬁned as mid-June to mid-October) of 2010 (when continuous monitoring was carried out at multiple discrete locations across the site). In both instances, generalised additive mixed effects models (GAMMs) were used to link detection rates to a suite of environmental variables representative of the oceanography of the region. We show that increased harbour porpoise detection rates in the late winter/early spring (January–March) are associated with low sea surface temperatures (SST), whilst peaks in dolphin detection rates in the summer (July–September) coincide with increased SSTs and the presence of a tidal-mixing front. Moreover, across the summer months of 2010, dolphin detection rates were found to respond to small scale changes in SST and position in the spring-neap cycle, possibly reﬂective of a preference for the stratiﬁed waters immediately offshore of the front. Together, these ﬁndings suggest that habitat use by small cetaceans within shelf-seas is temporally variable, species speciﬁc and likely driven by complex bottom-up processes. As such, the effective conservation management of shelf-seas requires that we understand the dynamic complexities of these systems and the species that inhabit them. In particular, we emphasise the need for a good understanding of the natural drivers of habitat use by marine megafauna before the potential impacts of anthropogenically induced disturbances, such as those associated with the construction, maintenance and operation of MREIs, can be assessed.},

Both historical observations and numerical model simulations are presented, outlining the diﬀerences and agreement. The model simulations are presented for both an eddy resolving and a coarse resolution numerical model and the results are intercompared. The importance of the mesoscales in modifying the large scale ﬂow ﬁeld is elucidated. The critical point is the discovery of the large amplitude interannual variability of the circulation and water mass structure associated with the anomalies of atmospheric forcing over the basin. The seasonal variability can be strictly related to changes in heat and momentum ﬂuxes, while the interannual variability has a component which is related to the mesoscale ﬁeld. The latter is very intense in the Algerian Current region and Levantine basin but diﬀerent in structure in the two regions. Results are shown, which conﬁrm the importance of wind driving in establishing the kinetic energy of the ﬂow ﬁeld, by comparing the current transport at the Strait of Corsica with observations. In conclusion, the essential characteristics of the present-day circulation are associated with the atmospheric forcing and the basin topographic structure. Results from palaeoceanographic simulations for the last 20 000 years show that changing the atmospheric forcing can cause large changes in the circulation structure which may have aﬀected sapropel formation. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The dynamic nature of oceanographic processes and the wide-ranging behavior of many marine vertebrates create further difﬁculties, as distribution data must incorporate both the spatial and temporal dimensions. Cetaceans play an essential role in structuring and maintaining marine ecosystems and face increasing threats from human activities. The Azores holds a high diversity of cetaceans but the information about spatial and temporal patterns of distribution for this marine megafauna group in the region is still very limited. To tackle this issue, we created monthly predictive cetacean distribution maps for spring and summer months, using data collected by the Azores Fisheries Observer Programme between 2004 and 2009. We then combined the individual predictive maps to obtain species richness maps for the same period. Our results reﬂect a great heterogeneity in distribution among species and within species among different months. This heterogeneity reﬂects a contrasting inﬂuence of oceanographic processes on the distribution of cetacean species. However, some persistent areas of increased species richness could also be identiﬁed from our results. We argue that policies aimed at effectively protecting cetaceans and their habitats must include the principle of dynamic ocean management coupled with other area-based management such as marine spatial planning.},

In this study, a seasonal comparison of the abundance and distribution of cetaceans was carried out in two contrasted regions of the Eastern North Atlantic, the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel. Estimates were obtained in the two sub-regions (375,000 km²) from large aerial surveys conducted in the winter (November 2011 to February 2012) and in the summer (May to August 2012). The most abundant species encountered in the Channel, the harbour porpoise, displayed strong seasonal variations in its distribution but a stable abundance (18,000 individuals, CV=30\%). In the Bay of Biscay, abundance and distribution patterns of common / striped dolphins varied from 285,000 individuals (95\% CI: 174,000–481,000) in the winter, preferentially distributed close to the shelf break, to 494,000 individuals (95\% CI: 342,000−719,000) distributed beyond the shelf break in summer. Baleen whales also exhibited an increase of their density in summer. Seasonal abundances of bottlenose dolphins were quite stable, with a large number of ‘pelagic’ encounters oﬀshore in winter. No signiﬁcant seasonal diﬀerence was estimated for pilot whales and sperm whale. These surveys provided baseline estimates to inform policies to be developed, or for existing conservation instruments such as the Habitats Directive. In addition, our results supported the hypothesis of a shift in the summer distributions of some species such as harbour porpoise and minke whale in European waters.},

	abstract = {Indonesia harbours a high diversity of cetaceans, yet effective conservation is hampered by a lack of knowledge about cetacean spatial distribution and habitat preferences. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap at an adequate resolution to support national cetacean conservation and management planning. Maximum Entropy (Maxent) modelling was used to map the distribution of 15 selected cetacean species in seven areas within Indonesian waters using recent cetacean presence datasets as well as environmental predictors (topographic and oceanographic variables). We then combined the individual species suitable habitat maps and overlaid them with provincial marine spatial planning (MSP) jurisdictions, marine protected areas (MPAs), oil and gas contract areas, and marine traffic density. Our results reflect a great heterogeneity in distribution among species and within species among different locations. This heterogeneity reflects an interrelated influence of topographic variables and oceanographic processes on the distribution of cetacean species. Bathymetry, distance to- coast and the − 200m isobaths, and chlorophyll-a concentration and sea surface temperature were important variables influencing distribution of most species in many regions. Areas rich in species were mainly related to coastal areas or insular-reef complexity, representing high productivity and upwelling-modified waters. Although some important suitable habitats currently fall within MPAs, other areas are not and overlap with oil and gas explo­ ration activities and marine traffic, indicating potentially high risk areas for cetaceans. The results of this study can support national cetacean conservation and management planning, and be used to reduce or avoid adverse anthropogenic threats. We advise to consider currently unprotected suitable cetacean habitats in MPA and MSP development.},

Depending on the geographic extent, elevation range, and spatial resolution of data used in making these models, different rates of habitat loss have been predicted, with associated risk of species extinction. Few coordinated across-scale comparisons have been made using data of different resolutions and geographic extents. Here, we assess whether climate change-induced habitat losses predicted at the European scale (10 Â 100 grid cells) are also predicted from local-scale data and modeling (25 m Â 25 m grid cells) in two regions of the Swiss Alps. We show that local-scale models predict persistence of suitable habitats in up to 100\% of species that were predicted by a European-scale model to lose all their suitable habitats in the area. Proportion of habitat loss depends on climate change scenario and study area. We ﬁnd good agreement between the mismatch in predictions between scales and the ﬁne-grain elevation range within 10 Â 100 cells. The greatest prediction discrepancy for alpine species occurs in the area with the largest nival zone. Our results suggest elevation range as the main driver for the observed prediction discrepancies. Local-scale projections may better reﬂect the possibility for species to track their climatic requirement toward higher elevations.},

We developed an ecosystem-specific, multiscale spatial model to synthesize 17 global data sets of anthropogenic drivers of ecological change for 20 marine ecosystems. Our analysis indicates that no area is unaffected by human influence and that a large fraction (41\%) is strongly affected by multiple drivers. However, large areas of relatively little human impact remain, particularly near the poles. The analytical process and resulting maps provide flexible tools for regional and global efforts to allocate conservation resources; to implement ecosystem-based management; and to inform marine spatial planning, education, and basic research.},

	abstract = {Marine mammals feed at a variety of trophic levels, occur from freshwater to openocean ecosystems and are found across virtually all latitudes. Due to their high historical, and sometimes present-day, abundances, capability for large-scale movements and high metabolic rates, they have the potential to affect the structure and function of ecosystems through a variety of mechanisms over both ecological and evolutionary time. Usually, the effects of marine mammals on ecosystems are explicitly or implicitly considered to occur through their ability to remove prey through direct predation. Recent empirical studies and a rich theoretical framework, however, demonstrate that marine mammals can affect ecosystems through more diverse pathways, including those that are driven by marine mammal behaviour. Thus, non-consumptive effects of and on marine mammals may be critical in shaping their ecological importance. Nonconsumptive effects may include risk effects, whereby predators induce costly changes to prey behaviour that impact prey population sizes or the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of prey impacts on communities (e.g. behaviour-mediated trophic cascades). Changes in the abundance of large apex predators (both marine mammals and sharks) and the introduction of perceived and real risks (human disturbance) may also affect behaviours of marine mammals and their prey that cascade to the wider ecosystem; the conditions under which such cascading effects might be most important, however, remain poorly understood. Other behaviour-driven ecological roles of marine mammals may include foraging tactics that facilitate the foraging of other species (especially seabirds), translocating nutrients and linking the dynamics of spatially distinct food webs.},

These clear physical changes undoubtedly affect marine ecosystems. Species dependent on sea ice, such as the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and the ringed seal (Phoca hispida), provide the clearest examples of sensitivity to climate change. Responses of cetaceans to climate change are more difﬁcult to discern, but in the eastern North Paciﬁc evidence is emerging that gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) are delaying their southbound migration, expanding their feeding range along the migration route and northward to Arctic waters, and even remaining in polar waters over winter—all indications that North Paciﬁc and Arctic ecosystems are in transition. To use marine mammals as sentinels of ecosystem change, we must expand our existing research strategies to encompass the decadal and ocean-basin temporal and spatial scales consistent with their natural histories.},

	abstract = {The Celtic Sea is a diverse ﬁshing ground that supports important commercial ﬁsheries for a range of demersal ﬁsh, large and small-bodied pelagic ﬁsh and a variety of cephalopods and other shellﬁsh. A regional overview of the main commercial ﬁsh stocks of the Celtic Sea and of the ﬁsh that occur in the vicinity of Jones Bank are provided through analyses of landings data from English and Welsh vessels, and from scientiﬁc trawl surveys. Dedicated smaller scale sampling via trawl surveys combined with baited cameras on and around the Jones Bank were also analysed to investigate the importance of sandbank habitats with attention paid to the differences in the species occurring on the top of the bank in comparison to adjacent off-bank habitats. Ofﬁcial landing statistics for UK (English and Welsh) vessels indicated that the predominant commercial demersal species in ICES Divisions VIIg,h (in terms of quantities landed) were anglerﬁsh, megrim, pollack and skates (Rajidae). There were, however, regional differences in the distribution of ﬁsh and ﬁsheries, and the area surrounding Jones Bank (ICES Rectangles 28E1 and 28E2) supports ﬁsheries for megrim, anglerﬁsh, skates, hake, ling and turbot, with otter trawl, gillnet and beam trawl the main gears used. Recent survey data collected with GOV (Grande Ouverture Verticale) trawl from the Celtic Sea (ICES Divisions VIIe-h, 2007–2010) were used to highlight the broad scale distribution of the main ﬁsh assemblages in the Celtic Sea. Analyses of the ﬁsh and cephalopod catches from these surveys indicated that there were four broad assemblages in the area, including (i) a region around the Cornwall (which will also be partly inﬂuenced by the necessity to use rockhopper ground gear on these rough grounds), (ii) the shallower regions of the north-western Celtic Sea (including parts of the Bristol Channel), (iii) the deeper parts of the outer shelf and (iv) the central Celtic Sea. These data also provided information on the ichthyofauna of the Jones Bank. Further site-speciﬁc data for bank and off-bank habitats were collected during dedicated surveys on the Jones Bank in 2008 using commercial trawlers and baited camera deployments. Twenty-three species were recorded on the top of the bank, where horse mackerel, haddock and boarﬁsh were the most abundant species; 18 species were found along the slope of the bank (with blue whiting, poor cod, hake and horse mackerel predominant) and 18 species observed off the bank (where catches were dominated by blue whiting, poor cod and hake). The differences between camera and trawls were important with cameras only picking up 28\% of the species seen in the trawls. However both camera and trawl results suggest that some species are very habitat speciﬁc, with species such as haddock only observed on the top of the bank, whilst Nephrops norvegicus was abundant on the ﬂat areas off the bank but was infrequent on the top of the bank. These results suggest that future surveys of offshore sandbank habitats should stratify sampling more speciﬁcally to deal with smaller scale features that may play an important role in providing a greater range of habitats than just their relative size would suggest.},

Here, we present the analysis of a 30year run with a global eddy-resolving (1/12°) version of the NEMO ocean model. Compared to the 1° and 1/4° equivalent versions, this simulation more realistically represents the shape of the Subpolar Gyre, the position of the North Atlantic Current, and the Gulf Stream separation. Other key improvements are found in the representation of boundary currents, multi-year variability of temperature and depth of winter mixing in the Labrador Sea, and the transport of overﬂows at the Greenland–Scotland Ridge. However, the salinity, stratiﬁcation and mean depth of winter mixing in the Labrador Sea, and the density and depth of overﬂow water south of the sill, still present challenges to the model. This simulation also provides further insight into the spatio-temporal development of the warming event observed in the Subpolar Gyre in the mid 1990s, which appears to coincide with a phase of increased eddy activity in the southernmost part of the gyre. This may have provided a gateway through which heat would have propagated into the gyre's interior.},

	abstract = {This work focuses on the study of habitats and communities of a high structural complexity area at different levels and scales. This gives us a better understanding of an area from an ecological point of view and at the same time provides us with tools that will facilitate management measures. It was developed in a complex circalittoral rocky platform of the central Cantabrian Sea (Bay of Biscay). The sampling was carried out using a towed photogrammetric vehicle and a rock dredge, which was used for the identification of the species. The first level of the study was the abiotic characterization of the area and the analysis of the communities. These analysis were developed using the unsupervised k-means classification method. For abiotic characterization we used the variables directly associated with the composition and morphology of the ground, such as backscatter, BPI (Bathymetric Position Index), roughness and slope. Depth was also included to discriminate between the cir­ calittoral and bathyal zones. We obtained 5 different classes, which we related to the ground types observed by photogrammetry. In the analysis of the communities, the cluster was based on the sampling units extracted from the images ({\textasciitilde}10 m), from which 5 assemblages were obtained, providing information on the most abundant species of each class supplied by the abiotic study. The second level was carried out considering a management approach and was based on the modeling of the area at lower resolution, more suitable for the analysis of the habitat-fisheries interactions. Thus, the main habitat-forming species (HFS) of the entire circalittoral area were used to perform delta models based on GAMs (Generalize Additive Models). Obtaining the predictions of pres­ ence/absence and combining it with the predictions of densities, we got the zero inflated values density-based model. As all the identified habitats have vulnerable benthic species of a certain size settled on rocky bot­ toms, they can all be considered to belong to the designation 1170 reefs of the Habitats Directive.},

	abstract = {The mean intensity of the NE Atlantic upwelling system at its northern limit (Galicia, NW Spain) decreased during the last 40 years. At the same time, warming of surface waters was detected. Plankton biomass and composition are expected to reﬂect such changes when integrated over large time and space scales. In this study, biomass, abundance and species composition of phyto- and zooplankton were analysed to search for signiﬁcant patterns of annual change and relations with upwelling intensity. Regionally integrated, mostly offshore, data were obtained from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (since 1958) whereas coastal data from Vigo and A Coruña came from the Radiales program (since 1987). No signiﬁcant trends were found in phytoplankton biomass at either regional or local scales. However, there was a signiﬁcant decrease in diatom abundance at regional scales and also of large species at local scales. Zooplankton abundance (mainly copepods) signiﬁcantly decreased offshore but increased near the coast. Biomass of zooplankton also increased near the coast, with the fastest rates in the south. Warm-water species, like Temora stylifera, were increasingly abundant at both regional and local scales. Signiﬁcant correlations between upwelling intensity and plankton suggest that climatic effects were delayed for several years. Our results indicate that the effects of large scale climatic trends on plankton communities are being effectively modulated within the pelagic ecosystem in this upwelling region.},

	abstract = {Statistical models of habitat preference and species distribution (e.g., Resource Selection Functions and Maximum Entropy approaches) perform a quantitative comparison of the use of space with the availability of all habitats in an animal’s environment. However, not all of space is accessible all of the time to all individuals, so availability is in fact determined by limitations in animal perception and mobility. Therefore, measuring habitat availability at biologically relevant scales is essential for understanding preference, but herein lies a trade-­off: Models fitted at large spatial scales, will tend to average across the responses of different individuals that happen to be in regions with contrasting habitat compositions. We suggest that such models may fail to capture local extremes (hotspots and coldspots) in animal usage and call this potential problem, homogenization. In contrast, models fitted at smaller scales will vary stochastically depending on the particular habitat composition of their narrow spatial neighborhood, and hence fail to describe responses when predicting for different sampling instances. This is the now well-d­ocumented issue of non-transferability of habitat models. We illustrate this tradeoff, using a range of simulated experiments, incorporating variations in environmental gradients, richness and fragmentation. We propose diagnostics for detecting the two issues of homogenization and non-transferability and show that these scale-r­elated symptoms are likely to be more pronounced in highly fragmented or steeply graded landscapes. Further, we address these problems by treating the neighborhood of each cell in the landscape grid as an individual sampling instance (with its own neighborhood), hence allowing coefficients to respond to the local expectations of environmental variables according to a Generalized Functional Response (GFR). Under simulation this approach is consistently better at estimating robust (i.e., transferable) habitat models at smaller scales, and less susceptible to homogenization at larger scales. At the same time, it represents the first application of a GFR to continuous space (rather than multiple, spatially distinct datasets), allowing the predictive advantages of this extension of species distribution models to become available to data from large-­scale but single-s­ite field studies.},

	abstract = {The distributions of highly mobile marine species such as cetaceans are increasingly modeled at basin scale by combining data from multiple regions. However, these basin‐wide models often overlook geographical variations in species habitat relationships between regions. We tested for geographical variations in habitat relationships for a suite of cetacean taxa between the two sides of the North Atlantic basin. Using cetacean visual survey data and remote sensing data from the western and eastern basin in summer, we related the probability of presence of twelve cetacean taxa from three guilds to seafloor depth, sea surface temperature and primary productivity. In a generalized additive model framework, we fitted 1) basin‐wide (BW) models, assuming a single global relationship, 2) region‐specific intercepts (RI) models, assuming relationships with the same shape in both regions, but allowing a region‐specific intercept and 3) region‐specific shape (RS) models, assuming relationships with different shapes between regions. RS models mostly yielded significantly better fits than BW models, indicating cetacean occurrences were better modeled with region‐specific than with global relationships. The better fits of RS models over RI models further provided statistical evidence for differences in the shapes of region‐specific relationships. Baleen whales showed striking differences in both the shapes of relationships and their mean presence probabilities between regions. Deep diving whales and delphinoids showed contrasting relationships between regions with few exceptions (e.g. non‐statistically different shapes of region‐specific relationships for harbor porpoise and beaked whales with depth). Our findings stress the need to account for geographical differences in habitat relationships between regions when modeling species distributions from combined data at the basin scale. Our proposed hypotheses offer a roadmap for understanding why habitat relationships may geographically vary in cetaceans and other highly mobile marine species.},
