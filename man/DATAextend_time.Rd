\title{function to duplicate data with times before the data timestamp, to investigate the AIS presence before the time of the data.}
\usage{
DATAextend_time(
  data,
  max_time_diff = 1 * 60 * 60,
  t_gap = 30,
  accelerate = T,
  average_at = 30
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data of interest for AIS extraction. Must contain a column "timestamp", "lon" and "lat" (numeric values).}

\item{max_time_diff}{number of seconds before the timestamp of every data timestamp, where boat positions are considered/extracted.}

\item{t_gap}{interval of time into which vessels positions are extracted, from the data timestamp up to "max_time_diff" seconds before. This defines also the time interval where boat are considered for the extraction.}

\item{accelerate}{TRUE or FALSE: if data timestamps must be averaged at "average_at" seconds to decrease the number of data timestamp to process and  strongly decrease the computation time.}

\item{average_at}{if accelerate = TRUE, average the data timestamps to +- average_at to decrease the number of data timestamp to process. This defines also the time interval where boat are considered for the extraction.}
}
\value{
the data frame with the lines duplicated for each "t_gap" to extract up to "max_time_diff". The output contains the columns:
timestamp_AIS_to_extract: timestamp for the extraction of the AIS for this line (= data timestamp if average_at = 0 & average_mmsi_at = 0 & accelerate = F).
diffTime_AIS_extraction_effort: difference, in seconds, between the timestamp to extract (timestamp_AIS_to_extract) and the data timestamp.
datetime_AIS_to_extract: datetime (ymd_hms) of timestamp_AIS_to_extract
}
\description{
